TITLE:   The Receptive
HEX:     2
0:    0
OVERALL: This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken line represents the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth. It is the perfect complement of THE CREATIVE--the complement, not the opposite,[1] for the Receptive does not combat the Creative but completes it. It represents nature in contrast to spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal as against the male-paternal. How ever, as applied to human affairs, the principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.   <P>   But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil. The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of evil to both.    <P>   [Note 1: Hexagrams that are opposites in structure are not necessarily opposites in meaning.]
TRANS:   The Receptive brings about sublime 				success, Furthering through the erseverance 				of a mare. If the superior man undertakes 				something and tries o lead, He goes astray; 				But if he follows, he finds guidance. It is 				avorable to find friends in the west and 				south, To forego friends in the ast and 				north. Quiet perseverance brings good 				fortune.
COMMENTS:The four fundamental aspects  of the Creative--"sublime success, furthering through perseverance" --are  also attributed to the Receptive. Here, however, the perseverance is more  closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive connotes spatial  reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. The  potential becomes real and the spiritual be comes spatial through a  specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare,"  is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just  as the dragon belongs to heaven.  Its tireless roaming over the plains is  taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol  chosen because the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse  with the gentleness and devotion of the cow.   <P>    Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad  impulses of the Creative can it make these im pulses real. Nature s  richness lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies  in its power to give them beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that  lives. It is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth  by the Receptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram  indicates is action in conformity with the situation. The person in  question is not in an independent position, but is acting as an assistant.  This means that he must achieve something. It is not his task to try to  lead--that would only make him lose the way--but to let himself be led. If  he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure to  find the right guidance. The superior man lets himself be guided; he does  not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation what is demanded of him  and then follows this intimation from fate.   <P>    Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in  the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized ate firmly set.  The time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and the south, for  west and south symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the  Creative as nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does  not mobilize all one s powers, the work to be accomplished will not be  done. Hence to find friends there means to find guidance. But in addition  to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for  this we need solitude. The east symbolizes the place where a man receives  orders from his master, and the north the place where he reports on what he  has done. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour  he must do without companions, so that the purity of the moment may not be  spoiled by factional hates and favoritism.

TITLE:   Return (The Turning Point)
HEX:     24
1:    1
OVERALL:  The idea of a turning point arises  from the fact that after the dark lines have pushed all of the light lines  upward and out of the hexagram, another light line enters the hexagram from  below. The time of darkness is past. The winter solstice brings the victory  of light. This hexagram is linked with the eleventh month, the month of the  solstice (December-January).
TRANS:   Return. Success. Going out and 				coming in without error. Friends come 				without blame. To and fro goes the way. On 				the seventh day comes return. It furthers 				one to have somewhere to go.
COMMENTS: After a time of decay comes  the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There  is movement but it is not brought about by force. The upper trigram K un is  characterized by devotion; thus the movement is natural, arising  spontaneously. For this reason the transformation of the old becomes easy.  The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with  the time; therefore no harm results. Societies of people sharing the same  views are formed. But since these groups come together in full public  knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatist  tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN is  based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course  completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything  artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time.  This is  the meaning of heaven and earth.   <P>    All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings  return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year  begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too  sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is  the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the  great darkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives  place to movement.

TITLE:   The Army
HEX:     7
2:    2
OVERALL:  This hexagram is made up of the  trigrams K an, water, and K un, earth, and thus it symbolizes the ground  water stored up in the earth. In the same way military strength is stored  up in the mass of the people--invisible in times of peace but always ready  for use as a source of power. The attributes of the two trigrams are danger  inside and obedience outside. This points to the nature of an army, which  at the core is dangerous, while discipline and obedience must prevail  outside.   <P>    Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong  nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are  subordinate. This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the  middle of one of the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather than  the upper trigram, it represents not the ruler but the efficient general,  who maintains obedience in the army by his authority.
TRANS:   The Army. The army needs 				perseverance And a strong man. Good fortune 				without blame.
COMMENTS: An army is a mass that needs  organization in order to become a fighting force.  Without strict  discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline must not be  achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the hearts of the  people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may develop his  abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must entrust  him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always a  dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore  it should not be re sorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be  used as a last recourse.   <P>    The justifying cause of a war, and clear and intelligible war aims, ought  to be explained to the people by an experienced leader. Unless there is a  quite definite war aim to which the people can consciously pledge  themselves, the unity and strength of conviction that lead to victory will  not be forth coming. But the leader must also look to it that the passion  of war and the delirium of victory do not give rise to unjust acts that  will not meet with general approval. If justice and perseverance are the  basis of action, all goes well.

TITLE:   Approach
HEX:     19
3:    3
OVERALL:  The Chinese word lin has a range of  meanings that is not exhausted by any single word of another language. The  ancient explanations in the Book of Changes give as its first meaning,  "becoming great." What becomes great are the two strong lines growing  into the hexagram from below; the light giving power expands with them. The  meaning is then further extended to include the concept of approach,  especially the approach of what is strong and highly placed in relation to  what is lower. Finally the meaning includes the attitude of condescension  of a man in high position toward the people, and in general the setting to  work on affairs. This hexagram is linked with the twelfth month  (January-February), when, after the winter solstice, the light power begins  to ascend again.
TRANS:   Approach has supreme success. 				Perseverance furthers. When the eighth month 				comes, There will be misfortune.
COMMENTS: The hexagram as a whole  points to a time of joyous, hopeful progress. Spring is approaching. Joy  and forbearance bring high and low nearer together. Success is certain. But  we must work with determination and perseverance to make full use of the  propitiousness of the time. And one thing more: spring does not last  forever. In the eighth month the aspects are reversed. Then only two  strong, light lines are left; these do not advance but are in retreat (see  next hexagram). We must take heed of this change in good time. If we meet  evil before it becomes reality--before it has even begun to stir--we can  master it.

TITLE:   Modesty
HEX:     15
4:    4
OVERALL:  This hexagram is made up of the  trigrams Kên, Keeping Still, mountain, and K un.  The mountain is the  youngest son of the Creative, the representative of heaven on earth. It  dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain that gather round  its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with heavenly light. This  shows what modesty is and how it functions in great and strong men. K un,  the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the earth: this is the  very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, by being placed  above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in lowly, simple  people: they are lifted up by it.
TRANS:   Modesty creates success. The 				superior man carries things through.
COMMENTS: It is the law of heaven to  make fullness empty and to make full what is modest; when the sun is at its  zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven, turn toward its setting,  and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In obedience to the same law,  the moon when it is full begins to wane, and when empty of light it waxes  again. This heavenly law works itself out in the fates of men also. It is  the law of earth to alter the full and to con tribute to the modest. High  mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys are filled up. It is  the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper the modest. And  men also hate fullness and love the modest.   <P>    The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill  themselves.  But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as  his behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive  forces. When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he  shines with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is  modest, he cannot be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his  work to the end without boasting of what he has achieved.

TITLE:   Darkening of the Light
HEX:     36
5:    5
OVERALL:  Here the sun has sunk under the earth  and is therefore darkened. The name of the hexagram means literally  "wounding of the bright"; hence the individual lines contain frequent  references to wounding. The situation is the exact opposite of that in the  foregoing hexagram. In the latter a wise man at the head of affairs has  able helpers, and in company with them makes progress; here a man of dark  nature is in a position of authority and brings harm to the wise and able  man.
TRANS:   Darkening of the Light. In 				adversity It furthers one to be 				persevering.
COMMENTS: One must not unresistingly  let himself be swept along by unfavorable circumstances, nor permit his  steadfastness to be shaken. He can avoid this by maintaining his inner  light, while remaining outwardly yielding and tractable. With this attitude  he can overcome even the greatest adversities.   <P>    In some situations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make his  will prevail in spite of difficulties in his im mediate environment.  Perseverance must dwell in inmost consciousness and should not be  discernible from without. Only thus is a man able to maintain his will in  the face of difficulties.

HEX:     46
6:    6
OVERALL:  The lower trigram, Sun, represents  wood, and the upper, K un, means the earth.  Linked with this is the idea  that wood in the earth grows upward. In contrast to the meaning of Chin,  PROGRESS (u), this pushing upward is associated with effort, just as a  plant needs energy for pushing upward through the earth. That is why this  hexagram, although it is connected with success, is associated with effort  of the will. In PROGRESS the emphasis is on expansion; PUSHING UPWARD  indicates rather a vertical ascent--direct rise from obscurity and  lowliness to power and influence.
TRANS:   Pushing Upward has supreme 				success. One must see the great man. Fear 				not. Departure toward the south Brings good 				fortune. 
COMMENTS: The pushing upward of the  good elements encounters no obstruction and is therefore accompanied by  great success. The pushing upward is made possible not by violence but by  modesty and adaptability. Since the individual is borne along by the  propitiousness of the time, he advances. He must go to see authoritative  people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success is assured. But  he must set to work, for activity (this is the meaning of "the south")  brings good fortune.

OVERALL:  The Receptive, which moves downward,  stands above; the Creative, which moves upward, is below. Hence their  influences meet and are in harmony, so that all living things bloom and  prosper. This hexagram belongs to the first month (February-March), at  which time the forces of nature pre pare the new spring.
TRANS:   Peace. The small departs, The 				great approaches. Good fortune. Success.
COMMENTS: This hexagram denotes a time  in nature when heaven seems to be on earth.  Heaven has placed itself  beneath the earth, and so their powers unite in deep harmony. Then peace  and blessing descend upon all living things.   <P>    In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places  show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior in their turn are well  disposed toward the highly placed. There is an end to all feuds.   <P>    Inside, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the  dark principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while  the dark is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good  elements of society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil  elements come under their influence and change for the better. When the  spirit of heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its  influence and takes its appropriate place.   <P>    The individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it again at  the top.  Here the small, weak, and evil elements are about to take their  departure, while the great, strong, and good elements are moving up. This  brings good fortune and success.

8:    8
OVERALL:  The strong line in the fourth place,  that of the leading official, meets with response and obedience from all  the other lines, which are all weak. The attribute of the upper trigram,  Chên, is movement; the attributes of K un, the lower, are obedience and  devotion. This begins a movement that meets with devotion and therefore  inspires enthusiasm, carrying all with it. Of great importance,  furthermore, is the law of movement along the line of least resistance,  which in this hexagram is enunciated as the law for natural events and for  human life.
TRANS:   Enthusiasm. It furthers one to 				install helpers And to set armies 				marching.
COMMENTS: The time of ENTHUSIASM  derives from the fact that there is at hand an eminent man who is in  sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts in accord with it.  Hence  he finds universal and willing obedience. To arouse enthusiasm it is  necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances to the character  of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural laws rests on  this principle of movement along the line of least resistance. These laws  are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of movement  immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from  their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. It  is the same with human society: only such laws as are rooted in popular  sentiment can be enforced, while laws violating this sentiment merely  arouse resentment.   <P>    Again, it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for the  completion of an undertaking without fear of secret opposition. It is  enthusiasm too that can unify mass movements, as in war, so that they  achieve victory.

OVERALL:  The hexagram Chên represents the  eldest son, who seizes rule with energy and power. A yang line develops  below two yin lines and presses upward forcibly.  This movement is so  violent that it arouses terror. It is symbolized by thunder, which bursts  forth from the earth and by its shock causes fear and trembling.
TRANS:   Shock brings success. Shock 				comes-oh, oh! Laughing words-ha, ha! The 				shock terrifies for a hundred miles, And he 				does not let fall the sacrificial spoon and 				chalice.
COMMENTS: The shock that comes from  the manifestation of God within the depths of the earth makes man afraid,  but this fear of God is good, for joy and merriment can follow upon it.   <P>    When a man has learned within his heart what fear and trembling mean, he is  safeguarded against any terror produced by outside influences. Let the  thunder roll and spread terror a hundred miles around: he remains so  composed and reverent in spirit that the sacrificial rite is not  interrupted. This is the spirit that must animate leaders and rulers of  men--a profound inner seriousness from which all outer terrors glance off  harmlessly.

OVERALL:  A lake occupies a limited space. When  more water comes into it, it overflows.  Therefore limits must be set for  the water. The image shows water below and water above, with the firmament  between them as a limit.   <P>    The Chinese word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide a  bamboo stalk. In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets  fixed limits upon expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means  the fixed limits that the superior man sets upon his actions--the limits of  loyalty and disinterestedness.
TRANS:   Limitation. Success. Galling 				limitation must not be persevered in.
COMMENTS: Limitations are troublesome,  but they are effective. If we live economically in normal times, we are  prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves us from humiliation.  Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation of world conditions.  In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter, day and night, and  these limits give the year its meaning. In the same way, economy, by  setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve property and  prevent injury to the people.   <P>    But in limitation we must observe due measure. If a man should seek to  impose galling limitations upon his own nature, it would be injurious. And  if he should go too far in imposing limitations on others, they would  rebel. Therefore it is necessary to set limits even upon limitation.

OVERALL:  Above we have Chên, the eldest son,  and below, Tui, the youngest daughter. The man leads and the girl follows  him in gladness. The picture is that of the entrance of the girl into her  husband s house. In all, there are four hexagrams depicting the  relationship between husband and wife. Hsien, INFLUENCE (31), describes the  attraction that a young couple have for each other; Hêng, DURATION (32),  portrays the permanent relationships of marriage; Chien, DEVELOPMENT (53)  reflects the protracted, ceremonious procedures attending the arrangement  of a proper marriage; finally, Kuei Mei, THE MARRYING MAIDEN, shows a young  girl under the guidance of an older man who marries her. [1]   <P>    [Note: 1. In China, monogamy is formally the rule, and every man has but  one official wife. This marriage, which is less the concern of the two  participants than of their families, is contracted with strict observance  of forms. But the husband retains the right also to indulge his more  personal inclinations. Indeed, it is the most gracious duty of a good wife  to be helpful to him in this respect. In this way the relationship that  develops becomes a beautiful and open one, and the girl who enters the  family at the husband s wish subordinates herself modestly to the wife as a  younger sister. Of course it is a most difficult and delicate matter,  requiring tact on the part of all concerned. But under favorable  circumstances this represents the solution of a problem for which European  culture has failed to find an answer. Needless to say, the ideal set for  woman in China is achieved no oftener than is the European ideal.]
TRANS:   The Marrying Maiden. Undertakings 				bring misfortune. Nothing that would 				further.
COMMENTS: A girl who is taken into the  family, but not as the chief wife, must behave with special caution and  reserve. She must not take it upon herself to supplant the mistress of the  house, for that would mean disorder and lead to untenable relationships.   <P>    The same is true of all voluntary relationships between human beings. While  legally regulated relationships evince a fixed connection between duties  and rights, relationships based on personal inclination depend in the long  run entirely on tactful reserve.   <P>    Affection as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest  importance in ail relationships in the world. For the union of heaven and  earth is the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise,  spontaneous affection is the all-inclusive principle of union.

12:    12
OVERALL:  While in the hexagram Ta Kuo,  PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT (28), the strong lines preponderate and are  within, inclosed between weak lines at the top and bottom, the present  hexagram has weak lines preponderating, though here again they are on the  outside, the strong lines being within. This indeed is the basis of the  exceptional situation indicated by the hexagram. When strong lines are  outside, we have the hexagram I, PROVIDING NOURISHMENT (27), or Chung Fu,  INNER TRUTH (6 i); neither represents an exceptional state. When strong  elements within preponderate, they necessarily enforce their will. This  creates struggle and exceptional conditions in general. But in the present  hexagram it is the weak element that perforce must mediate with the outside  world. If a man occupies a position of authority for which he is by nature  really inadequate, extraordinary prudence is necessary.
TRANS:   Preponderance of the Small. 				Success. Perseverance furthers. Small things 				may be done; great things should not be 				done. The flying bird brings the message: It 				is not well to strive upward, It is well to 				remain below. Great good fortune.
COMMENTS: Exceptional modesty and  conscientiousness are sure to be re warded with success; however, if a man  is not to throw him self away, it is important that they should not become  empty form and subservience but be combined always with a correct dignity  in personal behavior. We must understand the demands of the time in order  to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies and damages. In any event  we must not count on great success, since the requisite strength is  lacking. In this lies the importance of the message that one should not  strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things.   <P>    The structure of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is  brought by a bird. In Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT (28), the four  strong, heavy lines within, supported only by two weak lines without, give  the image of a sagging ridgepole. Here the supporting weak lines are both  outside and preponderant; this gives the image of a soaring bird. But a  bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the sun; it should  descend to the earth, where its nest is. In this way it gives the message  conveyed by the hexagram.

OVERALL:  Chên is movement; Li is flame, whose  attribute is clarity. Clarity within, movement without--this produces  greatness and abundance. The hexagram pictures a period of advanced  civilization. However, the fact that development has reached a peak  suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance cannot be  maintained permanently.
TRANS:   Abundance has success. The king 				attains abundance. Be not sad. Be like the 				sun at midday.
COMMENTS: It is not given to every  mortal to bring about a time of outstanding greatness and abundance. Only a  born ruler of men is able to do it, because his will is directed to what is  great. Such a time of abundance is usually brief. Therefore a sage might  well feel sad in view of the decline that must follow. But such sadness  does not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly free of sorrow and care can  lead in a time of abundance. He must be like the sun at midday,  illuminating and gladdening every thing under heaven.

HEX:     32
14:    14
OVERALL:  The strong trigram Chên is above, the  weak trigram Sun below. This hexagram is the inverse of the preceding one.  in the latter we have influence, here we have union as an enduring  condition. The two images are thunder and wind, which are likewise  constantly paired phenomena. The lower trigram indicates gentleness within;  the upper, movement without.   <P>    In the sphere of social relationships, the hexagram represents the  institution of marriage as the enduring union of the sexes. During  courtship the young man subordinates himself to the girl, but in marriage,  which is represented by the coming together of the eldest son and the  eldest daughter, the husband is the directing and moving force outside,  while the wife, inside, is gentle and submissive.
TRANS:   Duration. Success. No blame. 				Perseverance furthers. It furthers one to 				have somewhere to go.
COMMENTS: Duration is a state whose  movement is not worn down by hindrances. It is not a state of rest, for  mere standstill is regression. Duration is rather the self-contained and  therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole,  taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every  ending. The end is reached by an inward movement, by inhalation, systole,  contraction, and this movement turns into a new beginning, in which the  movement is directed outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion.   <P>    Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and  because of this their light-giving power endures. The seasons of the year  follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce effects  that endure.   <P>    So likewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way of  life, and thereby the world is formed. In that which gives things their  duration, we can come to under stand the nature of all beings in heaven and  on earth.

TITLE:   The Power of the Great
HEX:     34
15:    15
OVERALL:  The great lines, that is, the light,  strong lines, are powerful. Four light lines have entered the hexagram from  below and are about to ascend higher. The upper trigram is Chên, the  Arousing; the lower is Ch ien, the Creative. Ch ien is strong, Chên  produces movement. The union of movement and strength gives the meaning of  THE POWER OF THE GREAT. The hexagram is linked with the second month  (March-April).
TRANS:   The Power of the Great. 				Perseverance furthers.
COMMENTS: The hexagram points to a  time when inner worth mounts with great force and comes to power. But its  strength has already passed beyond the median line, hence there is danger  that one may rely entirely on one s own power and forget to ask what is  right. There is danger too that, being intent on movement, we may not wait  for the right time. Therefore the added statement that perseverance  furthers.  For that is truly great power which does not degenerate into  mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental principles of  right and of justice.  When we understand this point--namely, that  greatness and justice must be indissolubly united--we understand the true  meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.

TITLE:   Holding Together (Union)
HEX:     8
16:    16
OVERALL:  The waters on the surface of the  earth flow together wherever they can, as for example in the ocean, where  all the rivers come together. Symbolically this connotes holding together  and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is suggested by the fact that  all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the place of the ruler, are  yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they are influenced by a  man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is their center of  union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn holds together  with the others, finding in them the complement of his own nature.
TRANS:   Holding Together brings good 				fortune. Inquire of the oracle once again 				Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, 				and perseverance; Then there is no blame. 				Those who are uncertain gradually join. 				Whoever comes too late Meets with 				misfortune.
COMMENTS: What is required is that we  unite with others, in order that all may complement and aid one another  through holding together. But such holding together calls for a central  figure around whom other persons may unite. To become a center of influence  holding people together is a grave matter and fraught with great  responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit, consistency, and strength.  Therefore let him who wishes to gather others about him ask himself whether  he is equal to the under taking, for anyone attempting the task without a  real calling for it only makes confusion worse than if no union at all had  taken place.   <P>    But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or  uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late-comers must suffer  the consequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is  also important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according  to definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he  who comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it  if, as a straggler, he finds the door locked.   <P>    If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong  enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some  other organic fellowship.

TITLE:   Difficulty at the Beginning
HEX:     3
17:    17
OVERALL: The name of the hexagram, Chun, really  connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of  the earth--hence the meaning, "difficulty at the beginning." The hexagram  indicates the way in which heaven and earth bring forth individual beings.  It is their first meeting, which is beset with difficulties. The lower  trigram Chên is the Arousing; its motion is upward and its image is  thunder. The upper trigram K an stands for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its  motion is down ward and its image is rain. The situation points to teeming,  chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill the air. But the chaos clears up.  While the Abysmal sinks, the upward movement eventually passes beyond the  danger. A thunderstorm brings release from tension, and all things breathe  freely again.
TRANS:   Difficulty at the Beginning works 				supreme success, Furthering through 				perseverance. Nothing should be undertaken. 				It furthers one to appoint elpers.
COMMENTS:Times of growth are beset  with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But these difficulties  arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to attain form.   Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a prospect of  great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man s fate to  under take such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark. Hence  he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster.  Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome  the chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself  should look on passively at what is happening.  He must lend his hand and  participate with inspiration and guidance.

TITLE:   The Abysmal (Water)
HEX:     29
18:    18
OVERALL:  This hexagram consists of a doubling  of the trigram K an. It is one of the eight hexagrams in which doubling  occurs. The trigram K an means a plunging in. A yang line has plunged in  between two yin lines and is closed in by them like water in a ravine. The  trigram K an is also the middle son. The Receptive has obtained the middle  line of the Creative, and thus K an develops. As an image it represents  water, the water that comes from above and is in motion on earth in streams  and rivers, giving rise to all life on earth.   <P>    In man s world K an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the  body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark&mdash;that is, reason.  The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the  additional meaning, "repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended  to designate an ob jective situation to which one must become accustomed,  not a subjective attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means  either foolhardiness or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize  danger; it is a situation in which a man is in the same pass as the water  in a ravine, and, like the water, he can escape if he behaves correctly.   <P>    [Note: Tbe usual translation, "two bowls of rice," has been corrected on  the basis of Chinese commentaries.]
TRANS:   The Abysmal repeated. If you are 				sincere, you have success in your heart, And 				whatever you do succeeds.
COMMENTS: Through repetition of danger  we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the example for the right conduct  under such circumstances. It flows on and on, and merely fills up all the  places through which it flows; it does not shrink from any dangerous spot  nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose its own essential nature.  It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus likewise, if one is  sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can penetrate the  meaning of the situation.  And once we have gained inner mastery of a prob  lem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will succeed. In  danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be  done&mdash;thoroughness&mdash;and going forward, in order not to perish  through tarrying in the danger.   <P>    Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective  measure.  Thus heaven has its perilous height pro tecting it against every  attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water,  separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger  to protect them selves against attacks from without and against turmoil  within.

OVERALL:  A lake occupies a limited space. When  more water comes into it, it overflows.  Therefore limits must be set for  the water. The image shows water below and water above, with the firmament  between them as a limit.   <P>    The Chinese word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide a  bamboo stalk. In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets  fixed limits upon expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means  the fixed limits that the superior man sets upon his actions--the limits of  loyalty and disinterestedness.
TRANS:   Limitation. Success. Galling 				limitation must not be persevered in.
COMMENTS: Limitations are troublesome,  but they are effective. If we live economically in normal times, we are  prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves us from humiliation.  Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation of world conditions.  In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter, day and night, and  these limits give the year its meaning. In the same way, economy, by  setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve property and  prevent injury to the people.   <P>    But in limitation we must observe due measure. If a man should seek to  impose galling limitations upon his own nature, it would be injurious. And  if he should go too far in imposing limitations on others, they would  rebel. Therefore it is necessary to set limits even upon limitation.

OVERALL:  The hexagram pictures a dangerous  abyss lying before us and a steep, inaccessible mountain rising behind us.  We are surrounded by obstacles; at the same time, since the mountain has  the attribute of keeping still, there is implicit a hint as to how we can  extricate ourselves. The hexagram represents obstructions that appear in  the course of time but that can and should be overcome. Therefore all the  instruction given is directed to overcoming them.
TRANS:   Obstruction. The southwest 				furthers. The northeast does not further. It 				furthers one to see the great man. 				Perseverance brings good fortune.
COMMENTS: The southwest is the region  of retreat, the northeast that of advance. Here an individual is confronted  by obstacles that cannot be overcome directly. In such a situation it is  wise to pause in view of the danger and to retreat. However, this is merely  a preparation for overcoming the obstructions. One must join forces with  friends of like mind and put himself under the leadership of a man equal to  the situation: then one will succeed in removing the obstacles. This  requires the will to persevere just when one apparently must do something  that leads away from his goal. This unswerving inner purpose brings good  fortune in the end. An obstruction that lasts only for a time is useful for  self-development. This is the value of adversity.

OVERALL:  This hexagram is the evolution of  T ai, PEACE (11). The transition from confusion to order is completed, and  every thing is in its proper place even in particulars. The strong lines  are in the strong places, the weak lines in the weak places. This is a very  favorable outlook, yet it gives reason for thought. For it is just when  perfect equilibrium has been reached that any movement may cause order to  revert to disorder. The one strong line that has moved to the top, thus  effecting complete order in details, is followed by the other lines, each  moving according to its nature, and thus suddenly there arises again the  hexagram P i, STANDSTILL (12).   <P>    Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax,  which necessitate the utmost caution.
TRANS:   After Completion. Success in small 				matters. Perseverance furthers. At the 				beginning good fortune, At the end 				disorder.
COMMENTS: The transition from the old  to the new time is already accomplished. In principle, everything stands  systematized, and it is only in regard to details that success is still to  be achieved. In respect to this, however, we must be careful to maintain  the right attitude. Everything proceeds as if of its own accord, and this  can all too easily tempt us to relax and let things take their course  without troubling over details. Such indifference is the root of all evil.  Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result. Here we have the rule  indicating the usual course of history. But this rule is not an inescapable  law. He who under stands it is in position to avoid its effects by dint of  unremitting perseverance and caution.

TITLE:   The Well
HEX:     48
22:    22
OVERALL:  Wood is below, water above. The wood  goes down into the earth to bring up water. The image derives from the  pole-and-bucket well of ancient China. The wood represents not the buckets,  which in ancient times were made of clay, but rather the wooden poles by  which the water is hauled up from the well. The image also refers to the  world of plants, which lift water out of the earth by means of their  fibers.
TRANS:   The Well. The town may be changed, 				But the well cannot be changed. It neither 				decreases nor increases. They come and go 				and draw from the well. If one gets down 				almost to the water And the rope does not go 				all the way, Or the jug breaks, it brings 				misfortune.
COMMENTS: In ancient China the capital  cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake of more favorable  location, partly because of a change in dynasties. The style of  architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the well  has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well is the  symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its  most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political  structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs  remains eternally the same--this cannot be changed. Life is also  inexhaustible. It grows neither less nor more; it exists for one and for  all. The generations come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible  abundance.   <P>    However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social  organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life.  For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs  unsatisfied is as in-effectual as if no attempt at order had ever been  made. Carelessness--by which the jug is broken--is also disastrous. If for  instance the military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it  provokes wars by which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a  breaking of the jug.   <P>    This hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in  disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same  in everyone. And every human being can draw in the course of his education  from the in- exhaustible wellspring of the divine in man~s nature. But here  likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fall in his education to penetrate  to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention--a partial  education of this sort is as bad as none-- or he may suddenly collapse and  neglect his self-development.

OVERALL:  All beings have need of nourishment  from above. But the gift of food comes in its own time, and for this one  must wait. This hexagram shows the clouds in the heavens, giving rain to  refresh all that grows and to provide mankind with food and drink. The rain  will come in its own time. We cannot make it come; we have to wait for it.  The idea of waiting is further suggested by the attributes of the two  trigrams--strength with in, danger in front.2 Strength in the face of  danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weakness in the  face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.
TRANS:   Waiting. If you are sincere, You 				have light and success. Perseverance brings 				good fortune. It furthers one to cross the 				great water.
COMMENTS: Waiting is not mere empty  hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal.  Such certainty  alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads to the  perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the great  water.   <P>    One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and impatience  can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for his inner  security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself in  uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we have the  courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-  deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which  the path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by  resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate  resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately.  Then he will be able to  cross the great water--that is to say, he will be capable of making the  necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.

24:    24
OVERALL:  This hexagram is related in form and  meaning to Pi, HOLDING TOGETHER (8). In the latter, water is over the  earth; here a lake is over the earth. But since the lake is a place where  water collects, the idea of gathering together is even more strongly  expressed here than in the other hexagram. The same idea also arises from  the fact that in the present case it is two strong lines (the fourth and  the fifth) that bring about the gathering together, whereas in the former  case one strong line (the fifth) stands in the midst of weak lines.
TRANS:   Gathering Together. Success. The 				king approaches his temple. It furthers one 				to see the great man. This brings success. 				Perseverance furthers. To bring great 				offerings creates good fortune. It furthers 				one to undertake something.
COMMENTS: The gathering together of  people in large communities is either a natural occurrence, as in the case  of the family, or an artificial one, as in the case of the state. The  family gathers about the father as its head. The perpetuation of this  gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice to the ancestors, at  which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the collective piety of  the living members of the family, the ancestors become so integrated in the  spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed or dissolved.   <P>    Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed. But  there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group. In  order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all be  collected within him self. Only collective moral force can unite the world.  Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them.  This is the significance of the great offerings that are made. In the  secular sphere likewise there is need of great deeds in the time of  GATHERING TOGETHER.

The Joyous is the  youngest daughter, while the Arousing is the eldest son. An older man  defers to a young girl and shows her consideration. By this he moves her to  follow him.
TRANS:   Following has supreme success. 				Perseverance furthers. No blame.
COMMENTS: In order to obtain a  following one must first know how to adapt oneself. If a man would rule he  must first learn to serve, for only in this way does he secure from those  below him the joyous assent that is necessary if they are to follow him. If  he has to obtain a following by force or cunning, by conspiracy or by  creating factions, he invariably arouses resistance, which obstructs  willing adherence. But even joyous movement can lead to evil consequences,  hence the added stipulation, "Per severance furthers"--that is,  consistency in doing right-- together with "No blame." Just as we should  not ask others to follow us unless this condition is fulfilled, so it is  only under this condition that we can in turn follow others without coming  to harm.   <P>    The thought of obtaining a following through adaptation to the demands of  the time is a great and significant idea; this is why the appended judgment  is so favorable.

The upper trigram be longs to the  principle of darkness, the lower to the principle of light. Thus everywhere  superior men are oppressed and held in restraint by inferior men.   <P>    [Note: 1.

TRANS:   Oppression. Success. Perseverance. 				The great man brings about good fortune. No 				blame. When one has something to say, It is 				not believed.
COMMENTS: Times of adversity are the  reverse of times of success, but they can lead to success if they befall  the right man. When a strong man meets with adversity, he remains cheerful  despite all danger, and this cheerfulness is the source of later successes;  it is that stability which is stronger than fate. He who lets his spirit be  broken by exhaustion certainly has no success. But if adversity only bends  a man, it creates in him a power to react that is bound in time to manifest  itself. No inferior man is capable of this. Only the great man brings about  good fortune and remains blameless. It is true that for the time being out  ward influence is denied him, because his words have no effect. Therefore  in times of adversity it is important to be strong within and sparing of  words.

OVERALL: This hexagram, like Sun, is one of the  eight formed by doubling of a trigram. The trigram Tui denotes the youngest  daughter; it is symbolized by the smiling lake, and its attribute is  joyousness. Contrary to appearances, it is not the yielding quality of the  top line that accounts for joy here. The attribute of the yielding or dark  principle is not joy but melancholy. However, joy is indicated by the fact  that there are two strong lines within, expressing themselves through the  medium of gentleness.   <P>    True joy, therefore, rests on firmness and strength within, manifesting  itself outwardly as yielding and gentle
TRANS:   The Joyous. Success. Perseverance 				is favorable.
COMMENTS: The joyous mood is  infectious and therefore brings success. But joy must be based on  steadfastness if it is not to degenerate into uncontrolled mirth. Truth and  strength must dwell in the heart, while gentleness reveals itself in social  intercourse. In this way one assumes the right attitude toward God and man  and achieves something. Under certain conditions, intimidation without  gentleness may achieve something momentarily, but not for all time. When,  on the other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness, they are led  to take all hardships upon themselves willingly, and if need be will not  shun death itself, so great is the power of joy over men.

28:    28
OVERALL:  The name of the hexagram means  "universal," "general," and in a figurative sense "to influence" "to  stimulate." The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous; the lower is  Ken, Keeping Still. By its persistent, quiet influence, the lower, rigid trigram  stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds to this stimulation cheerfully  and joyously. Kên, the lower trigram, is the youngest son; the upper, Tui, is the  youngest daughter. Thus the universal mutual attraction between the sexes is  represented. In courtship, the masculine principle must seize the initiative and  place itself below the feminine principle.   <P>    Just as the first part of book I begins with the hexagrams of heaven and  earth, the foundations of all that exists, the second part begins with the  hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations of all social  relationships.
TRANS:   Influence. Success. Perseverance 				furthers. To take a maiden to wife brings 				good fortune.
COMMENTS: The weak element is above,  the strong below; hence their powers attract each other, so that they  unite. This brings about success, for all success depends on the effect of  mutual attraction. By keeping still within while experiencing joy without,  one can prevent the joy from going to excess and hold it within proper  bounds.  This is the meaning of the added admonition, "Perseverance  furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference between  seduction and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a position  inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for her. This  attraction between affinities is a general law of nature.  Heaven and earth  attract each other and thus all creatures come into being.  Through such  attraction the sage influences men s hearts, and thus the world attains  peace. From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all  beings in heaven and on earth.

But  while there the elder of the two daughters is above, and what results is  essentially only an opposition of tendencies, here the younger daughter is  above. The influences are in actual conflict, and the forces combat each  other like fire and water (lake), each trying to destroy the other. Hence  the idea of revolution.
TRANS:   Revolution. On your own day You 				are believed. Supreme success, Furthering 				through perseverance. Remorse disappears.
COMMENTS: Political revolutions are  extremely grave matters. They should be undertaken only under stress of  direst necessity, when there is no other way out. Not everyone is called to  this task, but only the man who has the confidence of the people, and even  he only when the time is ripe. He must then proceed in the right way, so  that he gladdens the people and, by enlightening them, prevents excesses.   Furthermore, he must be quite free of selfish aims and must really relieve  the need of the people. Only then does he have nothing to regret.   <P>    Times change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons change in the  course of the year. In the world cycle also there are spring and autumn in  the life of peoples and nations, and these call for social  transformations.

TITLE:   Preponderance of the Great
HEX:     28
30:    30
OVERALL:  This hexagram consists of four strong  lines inside and two weak lines outside.  When the strong are outside and  the weak inside, all is well and there is nothing out of balance, nothing  extraordinary in the situation. Here, however, the opposite is the case.  The hexagram represents a beam that is thick and heavy in the middle but  too weak at the ends. This is a condi tion that cannot last; it must be  changed, must pass, or misfortune will result.
TRANS:   Preponderance of the Great. The 				ridgepole sags to the breaking point. It 				furthers one to have somewhere to go. 				Success.
COMMENTS: The weight of the great is  excessive. The load is too heavy for the strength of the supports. The  ridgepole, on which the Whole roof rests, sags to the breaking point,  because its sup porting ends are too weak for the load they bear. It is an  excep tional time and situation; therefore extraordinary measures are  demanded.  It is necessary to find a way of transition as quickly as  possible, and to take action. This promises success. For although the  strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of  gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared.  Nothing is to be  achieved by forcible measures. The problem must be solved by gentle  penetration to the meaning of the situation (as is suggested by the  attribute of the inner trigram, Sun); then the change-over to other  conditions will be successful. It demands real superiority; therefore the  time when the great preponderates is a momentous time.

TITLE:   Break Through (Resoluteness)
HEX:     43
31:    31
OVERALL:  This hexagram signifies on the one hand  a break-through after a long accumulation of tension, as a swollen river  breaks through its dikes, or in the manner of a cloudburst. On the other  hand, applied to human conditions, it refers to the time when inferior  people gradually begin to disappear. Their influence is on the wane; as a  result of resolute action, a change in conditions occurs, a break-through.  The hexagram is linked with the third month [April-May].
TRANS:   
COMMENTS: Even if only one  inferior man is occupying a ruling position in a city, he is able to  oppress superior men.  Even a single passion still lurking in the heart has  power to obscure reason. Passion and reason cannot exist side by  side--therefore fight without quarter is necessary if the good is to  prevail.   <P>    In a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are however, definite rules  that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed. First, resolution must be based on  a union of strength and friendliness. Second, a compromise with evil is not  possible; evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited. Nor must our  own passions and shortcomings be glossed over. Third, the struggle must not be  carried on directly by force. If evil is branded, it thinks of weapons, and if we do  it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we  ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion. Therefore it is important to begin at  home, to be on guard in our own persons against the faults we have branded. In  this way, finding no opponent, the sharp edges of the weapons of evil become  dulled. For the same reasons we should not combat our own faults directly. As  long as we wrestle with them, they continue victorious. Finally, the best way to  fight evil is to make energetic progress in the good.

TITLE:   Splitting Apart
HEX:     23
32:    32
OVERALL:  The dark lines are about to mount  upward and overthrow the last firm, light line by exerting a disintegrating  influence on it. The inferior, dark forces overcome what is superior and  strong, not by direct means, but by undermining it gradually and  imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses.   <P>    The lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line being  the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses. The  hexagram belongs to the ninth month (October--November). The yin power  pushes up ever more powerfully and is about to supplant the yang power  altogether.
TRANS:   Splitting Apart. It does not 				further one To go anywhere.
COMMENTS: This pictures a time when  inferior people are pushing for ward and are about to crowd out the few  remaining strong and superior men. Under these circumstances, which are due  to the time it is not favorable for the superior man to undertake any  thing.   <P>    The right behavior in such adverse times is to be deduced from the images  and their attributes. The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose  attributes are docility and devotion. The upper trigram stands for the  mountain, whose attribute is stillness. This suggests that one should  submit to the bad time and remain quiet.  For it is a question not of man s  doing but of time conditions, which, according to the laws of heaven, show  an alternation of increase and decrease, fullness and emptiness. It is  impossible to counteract these conditions of the time. Hence it is not  cowardice but wisdom to submit and avoid action.

TITLE:   The Corners of the Mouth
HEX:     27
33:    33
OVERALL:  This hexagram is a picture of an open  mouth; above and below are the firm lines of the lips, and between them the  opening. Starting with the mouth, through which we take food for  nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment itself.  Nourishment of  oneself, specifically of the body, is represented in the three lower lines,  while the three upper lines represent nourishment and care of others, in a  higher, spiritual sense.
TRANS:   The Corners of the Mouth. 				Perseverance brings good fortune. Pay heed 				to the providing of nourishment And to what 				a man seeks To fill his own mouth with.
COMMENTS: In bestowing care and  nourishment, it is important that the right people should be taken care of  and that we should attend to our own nourishment in the right way.  If we  wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observe on whom he  bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates and  nourishes.  Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters and takes  care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them.  Mencius says about this:   <P>        If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only      observe what part of his being he regards as especially important. The      body has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We      must not injure important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor      must we injure the superior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who      cultivates the inferior parts of his nature is an inferior man. He who      cultivates the superior parts of his nature is a superior man.   <P>    [Note: Book of Mencius, bk. VI, sec. A, 14. [Mencius lived from 389 to 305  B.C.]]

TITLE:   Youthfyll Folly
HEX:     4
34:    34
OVERALL:  In this hexagram we are reminded of  youth and folly1 in two different ways. The image of the upper trigram,  Kên, is the mountain, that if the lower, K an, is water; the spring rising  at the foot of the mountain is the image of inexperienced youth.  Keeping  still is the attribute of the upper trigram; that of the lower is the  abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a dangerous abyss is  a symbol of the folly of youth. However, the two trigrams also show the way  of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something that of necessity  flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at first where it  will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its progress,  and success is attained.
TRANS:   Youthful Folly has success. It is 				not I who seek the young fool; The young 				fool seeks me. At the first oracle I inform 				him. If he asks two or three times, it is 				importunity. If he importunes, I give him no 				information. Perseverance furthers.
COMMENTS: In the time of youth, folly  is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it, provided one finds an  experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward him. This means,  first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his lack of  experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and this  interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which  should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the  reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering  himself. Only thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in  the right way.   <P>    A teacher s answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and  definite like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be  accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If  mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to  annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle  gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions implying  doubt.   <P>    Given in addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are  mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram  counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.

TITLE:   Decrease
HEX:     41
35:    35
OVERALL:  This hexagram represents a decrease  of the lower trigram in favor of the upper, because the third line,  originally strong, has moved up to the top, and the top line, originally  weak, has replaced it [1] What is below is decreased to the benefit of what  is above. This is out-and-out decrease. If the foundations of a building  are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened, the whole  structure loses its stability. Likewise, a decrease in the prosperity of  the people in favor of the government is out-and-out decrease. And the  entire theme of the hexagram is directed to showing how this shift of  wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation  and its lower classes to fail.   <P>    [Note: 1. [The present hexagram and the following one, INCREASE, are  regarded as formed by changes in T ai, PEACE (11), and Pi, STANDSTILL (12),  respectively. See p. 596.]]
TRANS:   Decrease combined with sincerity 				Brings about supreme good fortune Without 				blame. One may be persevering in this. It 				furthers one to undertake something. How is 				this to be carried out? One may use two 				small bowls for the sacrifice.
COMMENTS: Decrease does not under all  circumstances mean something bad. Increase and decrease come in their own  time. What matters here is to understand the time and not to try to cover  up poverty with empty pretense. If a time of scanty resources brings out an  inner truth, one must not feel ashamed of simplicity. For simplicity is  then the very thing needed to provide inner strength for further  undertakings.  Indeed, there need be no concern if the outward beauty of  the civilization even the elaboration of religious forms, should have to  suffer because of simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the inner  attitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of  the content makes up for the simplicity of form.  There is no need of  presenting false appearances to God. Even with slender means, the sentiment  of the heart can be expressed. [2]   <P>    [Note: 2. Cf. the story of the widow s mite in the Gospel of Luke.]

TITLE:   Keeping Still, Mountain
HEX:     52
36:    36
OVERALL:  The image of this hexagram is the  mountain, the youngest son of heaven and earth. The male principle is at  the top, because it strives upward by nature; the female principle is  below, since the direction of its movement is downward. Thus there is rest  because the movement has come to its normal end.   <P>    In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problem of achieving  a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart. While  Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement in  nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polarity  that always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words of the  text embody directions for the practice of yoga.
TRANS:   Keeping Still. Keeping his back 				still So that he no longer feels his body. 				He goes into his courtyard And does not see 				his people. No blame.
COMMENTS: True quiet means keeping  still when the time has come to keep still, and going forward when the time  has come to go forward. In this way rest and movement are in agreement with  the demands of the time, and thus there is light in life.   The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement. The back  is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate  movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a  standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were. When a  man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He no longer  sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he  has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the great  laws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever acts from  these deep levels makes no mistakes.

TITLE:   Grace
HEX:     22
37:    37
OVERALL:  This hexagram shows a fire that  breaks out of the secret depths of the earth and, blazing up, illuminates  and beautifies the mountain, the heavenly heights.  Grace--beauty of  form--is necessary m any union if it is to be well ordered and pleasing  rather than disordered and chaotic.
TRANS:   Grace has success. In small 				matters It is favorable to undertake 				something. 
COMMENTS: Grace brings success.  However, it is not the essential or fundamental thing; it is only the  ornament and must therefore be used sparingly and only in little things. In  the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two strong lines  and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential content  and the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper trigram of the  mountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strong  element must be regarded as the decisive factor. In nature we see in the  sky the strong light of the sun; the life of the world depends on it. But  this strong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety by the  moon and the stars. In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when  traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are made pleasing  by a lucid beauty. By contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we  come to understand time and its changing demands. Through contemplation of  the forms existing in human society it becomes possible to shape the world.   <P>    [Note: 1. This hexagram shows tranquil beauty--clarity within, quiet  without. This is the tranquillity of pure contemplation. When desire is  silenced and the will comes to rest, the world-as-idea becomes manifest. In  this aspect the world is beautiful and removed from the struggle for  existence. This is the world of art. However, contemplation alone will not  put the will to rest absolutely. It will awaken again, and then all the  beauty of form will appear to have been only a brief moment of exaltation.   Hence this is still not the true way of redemption. For this reason  Confucius felt very uncomfortable when once, on consulting the oracle, he  obtained the hexagram of GRACE.]

TITLE:   Work on What has been Spoiled [Decay]
HEX:     18
38:    38
OVERALL:  The Chinese character ku represents a  bowl in whose contents worms are breeding. This means decay. It has come  about because the gentle indifference of the lower trigram has come  together with the rigid inertia of the upper, and the result is stagnation.  Since this implies guilt, the conditions embody a demand for removal of the  cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram is not simply "what has been  spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled."
TRANS:   Work on What Has Been Spoiled Has 				supreme success. It furthers one to cross 				the great water. Before the starting point, 				three days. After the starting point, three 				days.
COMMENTS: What has been spoiled  through man s fault can be made good again through man s work. It is not  immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that has caused the state of  corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom. Work toward improving  conditions promises well, because it accords with the possibilities of the  time. We must not recoil from work and danger--symbolized by crossing of  the great water--but must take hold energetically. Success depends,  however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines, "Before  the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days." We  must first know the causes of corruption before we can do away with them;  hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the start. Then  we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that a  relapse may be avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time after  the start. Decisiveness and energy must take the place of the inertia and  indifference that have led to decay, in order that the ending may be  followed by a new beginning.

TITLE:   The Taming Power of the Great
HEX:     26
39:    39
OVERALL:  The Creative is tamed by Kên, Keeping  Still. This produces great power, a situation in contrast to that of the  ninth hexa gram, Hsiao Ch u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the  Creative is tamed by the Gentle alone.  There one weak line must tame five  strong lines, but here four strong lines are restrained by two weak lines;  in addition to a min ister, there is a prince, and the restraining power  therefore is far stronger.   <P>    The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the  concept "holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of  holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram Kên, which holds  the trigram Ch ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of  holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of car  ing for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong  line at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended  as a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this  strong line at the top, which represents the sage.
TRANS:   The Taming Power of the Great. 				Perseverance furthers. Not eating at home 				brings good fortune. It furthers one to 				cross the great water.
COMMENTS:To hold firmly to great  creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is  need of a strong, clear headed man who is honored by the ruler. The trigram  Ch ien points to strong creative power; Kên indicates firmness and truth.  Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character.   Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the height of  his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in  periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on  the power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in  the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler,  it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one s bread by  entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven;  therefore even great and difficult un dertakings, such as crossing the  great water, succeed.

COMMENTS: As an example of progress,  this pictures a time when a powerful feudal lord rallies the other lords  around the sovereign and pledges fealty and peace. The sovereign rewards  him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy.   <P>    A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress  emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others  regard as their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader has  enough clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use it  rather for the benefit of his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all  jealousy, showers presents on the great man, and invites him continually to  his court. An enlightened ruler and an obedient servant--this is the  condition on which great progress depends.

TITLE:   Biting Through
HEX:     21
41:    41
OVERALL:  This hexagram represents an open  mouth (cf. hexagram 27) with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between  the teeth. As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one  must bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up  of the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles  are forcibly removed in nature. Energetic biting through overcomes the  obstacle that prevents joining of the lips; the storm with its thunder and  lightning over comes the disturbing tension in nature. Recourse to law and  penalties overcomes the disturbances of harmonious social life caused by  criminals and slanderers. The theme of this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit,  in contradistinction to that of Sung, CONFLICT (6), which refers to civil  suits.
TRANS:   Biting Through has success. It is 				favorable to let justice be administered.
COMMENTS: When an obstacle to union  arises, energetic biting through brings success. This is true in all  situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the obstruction is due to  a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking the way. To  prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at once.  Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord.  Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.   <P>    However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines  Li, clarity, and Chên, excitement. Li is yielding, Chên is hard.  Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out  punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two  together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes  the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he  commands respect by his conduct in his position.   <P>    [Note:. Apart from the meaning of the hexagram as a whole, the single lines  are explained as follows: the persons represented by the first and the top  line suffer punishment, the others inflict it (see the corresponding lines  in hexagram 4, Mêng, YOUTHFUL FOLLY).]

The change is  indeed prepared for, since all the lines in the upper trigram are in  relation to those in the lower.  However, they are not yet in their places.   While the preceding hexagram offers an analogy to autumn, which forms the  transition from summer to winter, this hexagram presents a parallel to  spring, which leads out of winter s stagnation into the fruitful time of  summer. With this hopeful outlook the Book of Changes comes to its close.
TRANS:   Before Completion. Success. But if 				the little fox, after nearly completing the 				crossing, Gets his tail in the water, There 				is nothing that would further.
COMMENTS: The conditions are  difficult. The task is great and full of responsibility. It is nothing less  than that of leading the world out of confusion back to order. But it is a  task that promises success, because there is a goal that can unite the  forces now tending in different directions. At first, however, one must  move warily, like an old fox walking over ice. The caution of a fox walking  over ice is proverbial in China.  His ears are constantly alert to the  cracking of the ice, as he carefully and circumspectly searches out the  safest spots. A young fox who as yet has not acquired this caution goes  ahead boldly, and it may happen that he falls in and gets his tail wet when  he is almost across the water. Then of course his effort has been all in  vain. Accordingly, in times "before completion," deliberation and caution  are the prerequisites of success.

OVERALL:  This hexagram is composed of the  trigram Li above, i.e., flame, which burns upward, and Tui below, i.e., the  lake, which seeps downward. These two movements are in direct contrast.  Furthermore, Li is the second daughter and Tui the youngest daughter, and  although they live in the same house they belong to different men; hence  their wills are not the same but are divergently directed.
TRANS:   Opposition. In small matters, good 				fortune.
COMMENTS: When people live in  opposition and estrangement they cannot carry out a great undertaking in  common; their points of view diverge too widely. In such circumstances one  should above all not proceed brusquely, for that would only increase the  existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself to producing gradual  effects in small matters. Here success can still be expected, because the  situation is such that the opposition does not preclude all agreement.   <P>    In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents  polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and important  functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and nature, man and  woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction of life.  In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes possible  the differentiation by categories through which order is brought into the  world.

COMMENTS: When a man is a wanderer and  stranger, he should not be gruff nor overbearing.  He has no large circle  of acquaintances, therefore he should not give himself airs.  He must be  cautious and reserved; in this way he protects himself from evil. If he is  obliging toward others, he wins success.   <P>    A wanderer has no fixed abode; his home is the road.

The trigram represents the middle daughter.  The Creative has  incorporated the central line of the Receptive, and thus Li develops. As an  image, it is fire. Fire has no definite form but clings to the burning  object and thus is bright. As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames  up from the earth. While K an means the soul shut within the body, Li  stands for nature in its radiance.
TRANS:   The Clinging. Perseverance 				furthers. It brings success. Care of the cow 				brings good fortune.
COMMENTS: What is dark clings to what  is light and so enhances the brightness of the latter. A luminous thing  giving out light must have within itself something that perseveres;  otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything that gives light is  dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may continue to  shine.   <P>    Thus sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to the  earth.  So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is  right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is conditioned  and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself  dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he  achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating  in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires  clarity without sharp ness and finds his place in the world.   <P>    [Note: It is a noteworthy and curious coincidence that fire and care of the  cow are connected here just as in the Parsee religion. [According to the  Parsee belief the Divine Light, or Fire, was manifested in the mineral,  vegetable, and animal worlds before it appeared in human form. Its animal  incarnation was the cow, and Ahura-Mazda was nourished on her milk.]]

OVERALL:  The six lines construct the image of  Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom are the legs, over them the belly, then  come the ears (handles), and at the top the carrying rings. At the same  time, the image suggests the idea of nourishment. The ting, cast of bronze  was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the temple of the ancestors  and at banquets. The head of the family served the food from the ting into  the bowls of the guests. [1]   <P>    [Note: 1. [There are beautiful examples of the ting in most of our museums,  where they are classified as ritual vessels. The German word used by  Wilhelm for ting is Tiegel, meaning literally "caldron" and, in another  sense, "crucible." Since this characteristic Chinese vessel is unique in  form, so different from either a caldron or a crucible in the usual sense,  the word ting has been retained wherever feasible here.]]   <P>    THE WELL (48) likewise has the secondary meaning of giving nourishment, but  rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil pertaining to  a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men,  which redounded to the benefit of the state. [2]   <P>    [Note: 2. Cf. the other three hexagrams dealing with nourishment, viz.,  hexagrams 5, 27, 48.]   <P>    This hexagram and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that  represent concrete, man-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its  abstract connotation.   <P>    Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand  for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of  preparing food.
TRANS:   The Caldron. Supreme good fortune. 				Success.
COMMENTS: While THE WELL relates to  the social foundation of our life, and this foundation is likened to the  water that serves to nourish growing wood, the present hexagram refers to  the cultural superstructure of society. Here it is the wood that serves as  nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that is visible must grow beyond  itself, extend into the realm of the invisible. Thereby it receives its  true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the cosmic order.   <P>    Here we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion. The  ting serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest earthly values must  be sacrificed to the divine. But the truly divine does not manifest itself  apart from man. The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy  men. To venerate them is true veneration of God. The will of God, as  revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this brings inner  enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great  good fortune and success.

OVERALL:  The fire in heaven above shines far,  and all things stand out in the light and become manifest. The weak fifth  line occupies the place of honor, and all the strong lines are in accord  with it. All things come to the man who is modest and kind in a high  position.
TRANS:   Possession in Great Measure. 				Supreme success.
COMMENTS: The two trigrams indicate  that strength and clarity unite. Possession in great measure is determined  by fate and accords with the time. How is it possible that the weak line  has power to hold the strong lines fast and to possess them? It is done by  virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is favorable--a time of strength  within, clarity and culture without. Power is ex pressing itself in a  graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme success and wealth.

TITLE:   Contemplation [View]
HEX:     20
48:    48
OVERALL:  A slight variation of tonal stress  gives the Chinese name for this hexagram a double meaning. It means both  contemplating and being seen, in the sense of being an example. These ideas  are suggested by the fact that the hexagram can be understood as picturing  a type of tower characteristic of ancient China.   <P>    A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the same  time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen  for miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the law  of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by means of  good government, sets a lofty example to the masses.   <P>    This hexagram is linked with the eighth month (September-October). The  light-giving power retreats and the dark power is again on the increase.  However, this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram  as a whole.
TRANS:   Contemplation. The ablution has 				been made, But not yet the offering. Full of 				trust they look up to him.
COMMENTS: The sacrificial ritual in  China began with an ablution and a libation by which the Deity was invoked,  after which the sacrifice was offered. The moment of time between these two  ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment of deepest inner  concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith, the  contemplation of it has a transforming and awe- inspiring effect on those  who witness it.   <P>    Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that  natural occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the  divine meaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who  is called upon to influence others the means of producing like effects.  This requires that power of inner concentration which religious  contemplation develops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to  apprehend the mysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of  profoundest inner concentration they give expression to these laws in their  own persons. Thus a hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing  and dominating others with out their being aware of how it happens.

HEX:     42
49:    49
OVERALL:  The idea of increase is expressed in  the fact that the strong lowest line of the upper trigram has sunk down and  taken its place under the lower trigram. This conception also expresses the  fundamental idea on which the Book of Changes is based. To rule truly is to  serve.   <P>    A sacrifice of the higher element that produces an increase of the lower is  called an out-and-out increase: it indicates the spirit that alone has  power to help the world.
TRANS:   Increase. It furthers one To 				undertake something. It furthers one to 				cross the great water.
COMMENTS: Sacrifice on the part of  those above for the increase of those below fills the people with a sense  of joy and gratitude that is extremely valuable for the flowering of the  commonwealth. When people are thus devoted to their leaders, undertakings  are possible, and even difficult and dangerous enterprises will succeed.  Therefore in such times of progress and successful development it is  necessary to work and make the best use of the time. This time resembles  that of the marriage of heaven and earth, when the earth partakes of the  creative power of heaven, forming and bringing forth living beings. The  time of INCREASE does not endure, therefore it must be utilized while it  lasts.

OVERALL:  Wind blowing over water disperses it,  dissolving it into foam and mist. This suggests that when a man s vital  energy is dammed up within him (indicated as a danger by the attribute of  the lower trigram), gentleness serves to break up and dissolve the  blockage.   <P>    [Literally, in the German, "He dissolves himself from his group."]
TRANS:   Dispersion. Success. The king 				approaches his temple. It furthers one to 				cross the great water. Perseverance 				furthers.
COMMENTS: The text of this hexagram  resembles that of Ts ui, GATHERING TOGETHER (45). In the latter, the  subject is the bringing together of elements that have been separated, as  water collects in lakes upon the earth. Here the subject is the dispersing  and dissolving of divisive egotism. DISPERSION shows the way, so to speak,  that leads to gathering together. This explains the similarity of the two  texts.   <P>    Religious forces are needed to overcome the egotism that divides men. The  common celebration of the great sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which  gave expression simultaneously to the interrelation and social articulation  of family and state, was the means employed by the great rulers to unite  men. The sacred music and the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong  tide of emotion that was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened  a consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity  was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is  co-operation in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the  will of the people; in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers  dissolve, just as, when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must  unite in a joint task.   <P>    But only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations,  and who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so  dissolving the hardness of egotism.

TITLE:   Inner Truth
HEX:     61
51:    51
OVERALL:  The wind blows over the lake and  stirs the surface of the water. Thus visible effects of the invisible  manifest themselves. The hexagram consists of firm lines above and below,  while it is open in the center. This indicates a heart free of prejudices  and therefore open to truth. On the other hand, each of the two trigrams  has a firm line in the middle; this indicates the force of inner truth in  the influences they represent.   <P>    The attributes of the two trigrams are: above, gentleness, forbearance  toward inferiors; below, joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions  create the basis of a mutual confidence that makes achievements possible.   <P>    The character fu ("truth") is actually the picture of a bird s foot over  a fledgling. It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The  light-giving power must work to quicken it from outside, but there must be  a germ of life within, if life is to be awakened. Far-reaching speculations  can be linked with these ideas.
TRANS:   Inner Truth. Pigs and fishes. Good 				fortune. It furthers one to cross the great 				water. Perseverance furthers.
COMMENTS: Pigs and fishes are the  least intelligent of all animals and therefore the most difficult to  influence. The force of inner truth must grow great indeed before its  influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with persons as  intractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole  secret of success depends on finding the right way of approach. One must  first rid oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the  other person act on one without restraint. Then one will establish contact  with him, understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus been  opened, the force of one personality will influence him. If in this way one  finds no obstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most  dangerous things, such as crossing the great water, and succeed.   <P>    But it is important to understand upon what the force of inner truth  depends. This force is not identical with simple intimacy or a secret bond.  Close ties may exist also among thieves; it is true that such a bond acts  as a force but, since it is not invincible, it does not bring good fortune.  All association on the basis of common interests holds only up to a certain  point. Where the community of interest ceases, the holding together ceases  also, and the closest friendship often changes into hate. Only when the  bond is based on what is right, on steadfastness, will it remain so firm  that it triumphs over every thing.

OVERALL:  This hexagram is made up of Sun  (wood, penetration) above, i.e., without, and Kên (mountain, stillness)  below, i.e., within. A tree on a mountain develops slowly according to the  law of its being and consequently stands firmly rooted.  This gives the  idea of a development that proceeds gradually, step by step. The attributes  of the trigrams also point to this: within is tranquillity, which gnards  against precipitate actions, and without is penetration, which makes  development and progress possible.
TRANS:   Development. The maiden Is given 				in marriage. Good fortune. Perseverance 				furthers.
COMMENTS: The development of events  that leads to a girl s following a man to his home proceeds slowly. The  various formalities must be disposed of before the marriage takes place.  This principle of gradual development can be applied to other situations as  well; it is always applicable where it is a matter of correct relationships  of co-operation, as for instance in the appointment of an official. The  development must be allowed to take its proper course. Hasty action would  not be wise. This is also true, finally, of any effort to exert influence  on others, for here too the essential factor is a correct way of  development through cultivation of one s own personality. No influence such  as that exerted by agitators has a lasting effect.   <P>    Within the personality too, development must follow the same course if  lasting results are to be achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but at  the same time penetrating, is the outer form that should proceed from inner  calm.   <P>    The very gradualness of the development makes it necessary to have  perseverance, for perseverance alone prevents slow progress from dwindling  to nothing.

TITLE:   The Family
HEX:     37
53:    53
OVERALL:  This hexagram represents the laws  obtaining within the family. The strong line at the top represents the  father, the lowest the son. The strong line in the fifth place represents  the husband, the yielding second line the wife. On the other hand, the two  strong lines in the fifth and the third place represent two brothers, and  the two weak lines correlated with them in the fourth and the second place  stand for their respective wives. Thus all the connections and  relationships within the family find their appropriate expression. Each  individual line has the character according with its place. The fact that a  strong line occupies the sixth place--where a weak line might be  expected--indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come from  the head of the family. The line is to be considered here not in its  quality as the sixth but in its quality as the top line. THE FAMILY shows  the laws operative within the household that, transferred to outside life,  keep the state and the world in order. The influence that goes out from  within the family is represented by the symbol of the wind created by  fire.
TRANS:   The Family. The perseverance of 				the woman furthers.
COMMENTS: The foundation of the family  is the relationship between husband and wife. The tie that holds the family  together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. Her place is  within (second line), while that of the husband is without (fifth line). It  is in accord with the great laws of nature that husband and wife take their  proper places. Within the family a strong authority is needed; this is  represented by the parents. If the father is really a father and the son a  son, if the elder brother fulfills his position, and the younger fulfills  his, if the husband is really a husband and the wife a wife, then the  family is in order. When the family is in order, all the social  relationships of mankind will be in order.   <P>    Three of the five social relationships are to be found within the  family--that between father and son, which is the relation of love, that  between husband and wife, which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that  between elder and younger brother, which is the relation of correctness.  The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the prince in the  form of faithfulness to duty; the affection and correctness of behavior  existing between the two brothers are extended to a friend in the form of  loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the form of deference. The  family is society in embryo; it is the native soil on which performance of  moral duty is made easy through natural affection, so that within a small  circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this is later widened to  include human relationships in general.

OVERALL:  Sun is one of the eight doubled  trigrams. It is the eldest daughter and symbolizes wind or wood; it has for  its attribute gentleness, which nonetheless penetrates like the wind or  like growing wood with its roots.   <P>    The dark principle, in itself rigid and immovable, is dissolved by the  penetrating light principle, to which it sub ordinates itself in  gentleness. In nature, it is the wind that disperses the gathered clouds,  leaving the sky clear and serene. In human life it is penetrating clarity  of judgment that thwarts all dark hidden motives. In the life of the  community it is the powerful influence of a great personality that uncovers  and breaks up those intrigues which shun the light of day.
TRANS:   The Gentle. Success through what 				is small. It furthers one to have somewhere 				to go. It furthers one to see the great 				man.
COMMENTS: Penetration produces gradual  and inconspicuous effects. It should be effected not by an act of violation  but by influence that never lapses. Results of this kind are less striking  to the eye than those won by surprise attack, but they are more enduring  and more complete. If one would produce such effects, one must have a  clearly defined goal, for only when the penetrating influence works always  in the same direction can the object be attained. Small strength can  achieve its purpose only by subordinating itself to an eminent man who is  capable of creating order.

OVERALL:  This hexagram means the force of the  small--the power of the shadowy--that restrains, tames, impedes. A weak  line in the fourth place, that of the minister,1 holds the five strong  lines in check. In the Image it is the wind blowing across the sky. The  wind restrains the clouds, the rising breath of the Creative, and makes  them grow dense, but as yet is not strong enough to turn them to rain. The  hexagram presents a configuration of circum stances in which a strong  element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element. It is only through  gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.
TRANS:   The Taming Power of the Small Has 				success. Dense clouds, no rain from our 				western region.
COMMENTS: This image refers to the  state of affairs in China at the time when King Wên, who came originally  from the west, was in the east at the court of the reigning tyrant Chou  Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale had not yet arrived. King Wên  could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendly persuasion. Hence  the image of many clouds, promising moisture and blessing to the land,  although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not unfavorable; there is a  prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles in the way, and  we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the small means of  friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet come  for sweeping measures.  However, we may be able, to a limited extent, to  act as a restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our purpose we  need firm determination within and gentleness and adaptability in external  relations.

COMMENTS: Heaven and earth are out of  communion and all things are benumbed. What is above has no relation to  what is below, and on earth confusion and disorder prevail. The dark power  is within, the light power is without. Weakness is within, harshness  without. Within are the inferior, and without are the superior. The way of  inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior people is on the decline.  But the superior people do not allow themselves to be turned from their  principles. If the possibility of exerting influence is closed to them,  they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and withdraw into  seclusion.

57:    57
OVERALL:  Ch ien, heaven, is above; Chên,  movement, is below. The lower trigram Chên is under the influence of the  strong line it has received from above, from heaven.  When, in accord with  this, movement follows the law of heaven, man is innocent and without  guile. His mind is natural and true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior  designs. For wherever conscious purpose is to be seen, there the truth and  innocence of nature have been lost. Nature that is not directed by the  spirit is not true but degenerate nature. Starting out with the idea of the  natural, the train of thought in part goes somewhat further and thus the  hexagram includes also the idea of the unintentional or unexpected.
TRANS:   Innocence. Supreme success. 				Perseverance furthers. If someone is not as 				he should be, He has misfortune, And it does 				not further him To undertake anything.
COMMENTS: Man has received from heaven  a nature innately good, to guide him in all his movements. By devotion to  this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that  leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior  thought of reward and personal advantage. This instinctive certainty brings  about supreme success and "furthers through perseverance." However, not  everything instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the word, but only  that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven. With out this  quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of acting brings  only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs from  innocence, what does he come to? Heaven s will and blessing do not go with  his deeds."

OVERALL:  The upper trigram, whose image is  heaven, has an upward movement; the lower trigram, water, in accordance  with its nature tends downward. Thus the two halves move away from each  other, giving rise to the idea of conflict.   <P>    The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger,  guile.  Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict.   <P>    A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the  combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A  person of this character will certainly be quarrelsome.
TRANS:   Conflict. You are sincere And are 				being obstructed. A cautious halt halfway 				brings good fortune. Going through to the 				end brings misfortune. It furthers one to 				see the great man. It does not further one 				to cross the great water.
COMMENTS: Conflict develops when one  feels himself to be in the right and runs into opposition. If one is not  convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to craftiness or  high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.   <P>    If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so  clear-headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms  by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry on the conflict to the bitter end  has evil effects even when one is in the right, because the enmity is then  perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial  man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or  assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to  be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in  order to be successful they require concerted unity of forces.  Conflict  within weakens the power to conquer danger without.

This shows the difference  between high and low, upon which composure, correct social conduct,  depends. On the other hand, the word for the name of the hexagram,  TREADING,1 means literally treading upon something. The small and cheerful  [Tui] treads upon the large and strong [Ch ien]. The direction of movement  of the two primary trigrams is upward. The fact that the strong treads on  the weak is not mentioned in the Book of Changes, because it is taken for  granted. For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not dangerous  here, because it happens in good humor [Tui] and without presumption, so  that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all in good part.
TRANS:   Treading. Treading upon the tail 				of the tiger. It does not bite the man. 				Success.
COMMENTS: The situation is really  difficult. That which is strongest and that which is weakest are close  together. The weak follows behind the strong and worries it. The strong,  however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the contact is in  good humor and harmless.   In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, in tractable people.  In such a case one s purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum.  Pleasant manners succeed even with irritable people.

OVERALL:  The power of the dark is ascending.  The light retreats to security, so that the dark cannot encroach upon it.  This retreat is a matter not of man s will but of natural law. Therefore in  this case withdrawal is proper; it is the correct way to behave in order  not to exhaust one s forces.   <P>    In the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July-August),  in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.   <P>     [Note: 1. The idea expressed by this hexagram is similar to that in the  saying of Jesus: "But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil" (Matt.  5:39).]
TRANS:   Retreat. Success. In what is 				small, perseverance furthers.
COMMENTS: Conditions are such that the  hostile forces favored by the time are advancing. In this case retreat is  the right course, and it is through retreat that success is achieved. But  success consists in being able to carry out the retreat correctly.  Retreat  is not to be confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any  circumstances, whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful  not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power and  position. Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before  it is too late and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being  drawn into a desperate life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not simply  abandon the field to the opponent; we make it difficult for him to advance  by showing perseverance in single acts of resistance. In this way we  prepare, while retreating, for the counter movement.  Understanding the  laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is not easy. The meaning that  lies hidden in such a time is important.

TITLE:   Fellowship with Men
HEX:     13
61:    61
OVERALL:  The image of the upper trigram Ch ien  is heaven, and that of the lower, Li, is flame. It is the nature of fire to  flame up to heaven. This gives the idea of fellowship. It is the second  line that, by virtue of its central character, unites the five strong lines  around it. This hexagram forms a complement to Shih, THE ARMY (7). In the  latter, danger is within and obedience without--the character of a warlike  army, which, in order to hold together, needs one strong man among the many  who are weak. Here, clarity is within and strength without--the character  of a peaceful union of men, which, in order to hold together, needs one  yielding nature among many firm persons.
TRANS:   Fellowship with Men in the open. 				Success. It furthers one to cross the great 				water. The perseverance of the superior man 				furthers.
COMMENTS: True fellowship among men  must be based upon a concern that is universal. It is not the private  interests of the individual that create lasting fellowship among men, but  rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that fellowship with  men in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, even difficult  and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can be accomplished.  But in order to bring about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and  enlightened leader is needed--a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring  aims and the strength to carry them out. (The inner trigram means clarity;  the outer, strength.)

TITLE:   Coing to Meet
HEX:     44
62:    62
OVERALL:  This hexagram indicates a situation  in which the principle of darkness, after having been eliminated, furtively  and unexpectedly obtrudes again from within and below. Of its own accord  the female principle comes to meet the male. It is an unfavorable and  dangerous situation, and we must under stand and promptly prevent the  possible consequences.   <P>    The hexagram is linked with the fifth month [June-July], because at the  summer solstice the principle of darkness gradually becomes ascendant  again.
TRANS:   Coming to Meet. The maiden is 				powerful. One should not marry such a 				maiden.
COMMENTS: The rise of the inferior  element is pictured here in the image of a bold girl who lightly surrenders  herself and thus seizes power. This would not be possible if the strong and  light-giving element had not in turn come halfway. The inferior thing seems  so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it; it looks so small and  weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to no harm.   <P>    The inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him as  dangerous and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the first, he  could never gain influence.   <P>    The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way. Although as a  general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times  when this has great significance. When heaven and earth come to meet each  other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet  each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for elements  predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another  halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior  motives, otherwise harm will result.

TITLE:   The Creative
HEX:     1
63:    63
OVERALL: The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.   <P>   The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense--in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.   [Note: The hexagram is assigned to the fourth month, May-June, when the light-giving power is at its zenith, i.e., before the summer solstice has marked the beginning of the years decline. [The German text reads "April-May"; this is obviously a slip, for the first month of the Chinese lunar year extends approximately from the beginning of February to the beginning of March. New Year is a variable date, falling around February 5. Two or three other slips of this sort occurring later in the book have been similarly corrected, but without special mention.]
TRANS:   The Creative works sublime 				success, Furthering [2] through 				perseverance. [Note 2: The German word used 				here fördernd, literally rendered by 				"furthering." It occurs again and again as a 				key word in Wilhelm s rendering of the 				Chinese text. To avoid extreme awkwardness, 				the phrase "is favorable" is occasionally 				used as an alternative.]
COMMENTS:According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what is right.   <P>   The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime" means literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in explaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven" [3] For this attribute inheres in the other three as well.   <P>   [Note 3: This quotation and those following are from commentary material on this hexagram appearing in bk. III. It will be noted here, as well as in a number of other instances, that the wording of the passages is not identical in the two books.]   <P>   The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and the process is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."    <P>   [Note 4: Cf. Gen. 2:1 ff., where the development of the different creatures is also attributed to the fall of rain.]   <P>   Applied to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable success: "Because he sees with great clarity causes and effects, he completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on six dragons." The six steps are the six different positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the universe [tao], which, as a law running through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.   <P>   The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms "furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords with the nature of a given being") and "persevering" (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus does it show itself to further through perseverance."   <P>   In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in creating order: "He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."   <P>   Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words "sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance," and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the attribute success are linked the mores5, which regulate and organize the expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached in the commentary called Wên Yen,6 later formed the bridge connecting the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism. [5]   <P>   [Note 5: "Mores" is the word chosen to render the German word Sitte, when the latter refers, as in the present instance, to what the Chinese know as ii.However, neither "mores" nor any other available English word, such as "manners" or "customs", conveys an adequate idea of what li stood for in ancient China, because none of them necessarily denotes anything more than behavior growing out of and regulated by tradition. The ideas for which li stands seem to have had their origin in a religious attitude to life and in ethical principles developing out of that attitude. On the religious side li meant the observance with true piety of the ritual through which the "will of heaven" was interpreted and made to prevail on earth. On the moral side it meant the sense of propriety--understood to be innate in man--that, through training, makes possible right relationships in personal life and in society. Li was the cornerstone upon which Confucius built in his effort to bring order out of chaos in his era (see The Sacred Books of the East, XXVII: The Li Ki). Obedience to the code of li was entirely self-imposed as regards the "superior man", who in feudal times was always a man of rank. The conduct of the "inferior man"--the lower-class individual--was governed by law.]
