# [BabelBrowser](http://babelbrowser.com)

BabelBrowser look like an I Ching site, which it is, but it is intended to be a lot more.  It is an evolving website intended to collect and integrate information into a framework that is based on an ancient model of 32 pairs of universal concepts.  This model is the foundation for the I Ching, the Qabalah \(and therefore the Tarot\), as well as less well known esoterica, but also maps very neatly to binary and math systems, biology, Buddhist, Hindu and many other teaching.  Ths I Ching, due to its mathematical and structured nature, is perhaps the best example of this self organizing, organic, 32 node pattern of phenomonology, despite it's currently hyper-moral Confucian interpretation.  This is why it is the first to be integrated.

Currently the site uses the Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the I Ching. Editor comments can be made, but this editing system will be expanded into a cross-referencing data collection tool that will eventually shed more and more light on what would essentially be a holistic 'gestalt' of natural undestanding.

The I Ching+ database can the queried through the web interface at [http://babelbrowser.com](http://babelbrowser.com). From there you can throw coins, browse the data, manually enter two hexagrams to see how they relate, and more \(coming soon\).

This code and data for the hexagram browser is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/baardev/iching) \(it's a lot of undocumented code with various spaghetti scripts, at best\), and the GitBook content is available from [here](https://github.com/baardev/iching_book).  However, as I have no right to the Wilhelm/Baynes material I am probably breaking copyright law making it publicly available.  That means you may also be violating copyright law by downloading it and using it.

That said, if you want to contribute in any way to this project, please do.

Here are some of the goals...

* A framework for I Ching data storage, which includes a library, API, semantic store, cross-referencing to other data, etc.
* A true random number generator based on radioactive decay \(and other methods as well\), much like the one at Fermi Labs \(which seems to have disappeared\), also with an API. This also opens the door to integration with other noosphere projects.
* I would love to create a cryptocurrency for the I Ching \(the value of that is too involved to get into here\). 
* One of the best books on the I Ching is [The Portable Dragon](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Dragon-Western-Guide-Ching/dp/0262690306), edited by Dr. Sui, who collected works of soldiers, artists, kings, scientists, and more, from across all history, and used their writing to replace the popular interpretations we have inherited from the Confucian school. I would like to integrate that, and similar work into this, with Dr. Sui's permission, of course.  From there, I would like to see people start to enter their own understandings and to integrate that as well.
* Lastly, there is the idea that the binary nature of the I Ching lends itself to math, and from that math, much more can be revealed.  This is what Leibniz was doing with the I Ching, after he was shown a copy by the Jesuit Monks who brought it back to Germany from China.  Coincidently, Leibniz was, at that same time, working on a form of binary math that was specifically all meant to be the math of divinity.

## Of course, one way to contribue is to to donate :\)
