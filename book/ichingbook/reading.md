#<span style="color:gray"> Instructions for reading the I Ching</span>

This is a massive topic to cover, certainly more than what can be covered here.  I will only touch upon some basic ideas.

####Common, but unclear, terms (at least for me)
* Perserverance of a woman

* The superior/inferior man
>This term is so common and used in so many contexts that it is difficult to say precisely what it means. I assume that back in the day the Chinese had a very specific meaning for this term, and it was probably very socially constructed. Today, I would say that the superior Man is one whose inner values (integrity, honesty, etc.) take priority over material, or external, values (wealth, position, power, etc.) 

* Perserverance Furthers
> This has always been confusing to me as what does it mean to 'perservere'?  Does it mean just keep plodding ahead?  In **FOLLOWING (17)** it specifically states that "`'Perseverance furthers' --that is, consistency in doing right`".  This is only slightly less vague as 'right' is still pretty subjective.  However, if we can accept the very general definition of 'right' as '`not going against your own nature`' and '`not causing harm to others`', then "Perservernce Furthers"  would mean "**Continue acting in the way you feel is best suited to your inner intentions, you own values, while being respectful of others along the way**"

* No Blame
>This typically means "it's not your fault if everything falls apart", but I prefer to think of this as "**Just because things have gone in a different direction than you were hoping or planning, it is in harmonmy with the situation at hand.**"  Moreover, there is "no blame" because you were "perservering" as a "superior man", therefore, as unpleasant as the situation may turn out to be, you have remained true to yourself.

* Supreme Good Furtune
