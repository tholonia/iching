### This "Hexagrams" section is simply the generated pages for each hexagram using the data in our database.  For the most part, the data is straight out of the Wilhelm/Baynes translation, but more info is being added regularly.

### These generated pages are also the ones used for the website \([http://babelbrowser.com](http://babelbrowser.com)\) and the BabelBrowser mobile app.
