* (2) WATER / WATER is the symbol of yang energy penetrating the yin at its core.  ( movement, nouirishment)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *WATER* represents the movement from dark to light, yin to yang, lifelessness to life.  It is cardinal, spring equinox, ascending, the perfect balance of lessening yin and increasing yang. Instance of this are **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, **rivers**.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of WATER<img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of FILLING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/>and represents the balance between the yin and yang. that is achieved when yang penetrates the yin at is center. The oceans and lakes have filled and are stagnant until the rivers form which serves to collect the water to return it to its cycles..  It is the most *inward* moving of all the states.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yang energy penetrating the yin at its core. <br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> Water cedes to whatever holds it.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The movement of water is what gives it it power.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> it is the yielding quality of water that is its contributions. If always follows the path of least resistance, is used by every form of life and Nature itself, and is then returned, essentially unchanged. It takes nothing, and gives everything.

* (5) FIRE / FIRE is the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes. ( energy, heat,light)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *FIRE* represents the quality that allow for manifestation, transforming idea to form. It is cardinal, fall equinox, descending, the perfect balance of lessening yang and increasing yin. Instance of this are **light**, **consumption**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of RELEASE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and EMPTYING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the dissipation of energy, which bring form in to existence and light into the world. This is the balanced that represents the hight of outward expression.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang is built up and is ready to be released.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The yin returns as the yang is released, which is defined by dissipation and entropy.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The energy is shared with the world, as light, heat, and movement. <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
AFTER COMPLETION.<br/>
Success in small matters.<br/>
Perseverance furthers.<br/>
At the beginning good fortune.<br/>
At the end disorder.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
The transition from the old to the new time is already accomplished. In Principle, everything stands systematized, and it is only in regard to details that success is still to be achieved. In respect to this, however, we must be careful to maintain the right attitude. Everything proceeds as if of its own accord, and this can all too easily tempt us to relax and let thing take their course without troubling over details. Such indifference is the root of all evil. Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result. Here we have the rule indicating the usual course of history. But this rule is not an inescapable law. He who understands it is in position to avoid its effects by dint of unremitting perseverance and caution.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Water over fire: the image of the condition In AFTER COMPLETION. Thus the superior man Takes thought of misfortune And arms himself against it in advance.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
When water in a kettle hangs over fire, the two elements stand in relation and thus generate energy (cf. the production of steam). But the resulting tension demands caution. If the water boils over, the fire is extinguished and its energy is lost. If the heat is too great, the water evaporates into the air. These elements here brought into relation and thus generating energy are by nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution can prevent damage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are in balance and work in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best of order. In such times only the sage recognizes the moments that bode danger and knows how to banish it by means of timely precautions.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Nine at the beginning means: ***

_He breaks his wheels.<br/>
He gets his tail in the water.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In times following a great transition, everything is pressing forward,striving in the direction of development and progress. But this pressing forward at the beginning is not good; it overshoots the mark and leads with certainty to loss and collapse. Therefore a man of strong character does not allow himself to be infected by the general intoxication but checks his course in time. He may indeed not remain altogether untouched by the disastrous consequences of the general pressure, but he is hit only from behind like a fox that, having crossed the water, at the last minute gets its tail wet. He will not suffer any real harm, because his behavior has been correct.

*** Six in the second place means: ***

_The woman loses the curtain of her carriage,<br/>
Do not run after it,<br/>
On the seventh day you will get it._

*** Commentary on the line ***
When a woman drove out in her carriage, she had a curtain that hid her from the glances of the curious. It was regarded as a breach of propriety to drive on if this curtain was lost. Applied to public life, this means that a man who wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the authorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection. Especially in times"after completion" it may happen that those who have come to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves about fostering newtalent. This as a rule results in office seeking. If a man's superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthy procedure: "Do not seek it." Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change.When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man's own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord.He need only be able to wait.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_The Illustrious Ancestor Disciplines the Devil's Country.<br/>
After three years he conquers it.<br/>
Inferior people must not be employed._

*** Commentary on the line ***
"Illustrious Ancestor" is the dynastic title of the Emperor Wu Ting of the Yin dynasty. After putting his realm in order with a strong hand, he waged long colonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied the northern borderland with constant threat of incursions. <br/>
<br/>
The situation described is as follows. After times of completion, when a new power has arisen and everything within the country has been set in order, a period of colonial expansion almost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out struggles must be reckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy is especially important. The territory won at such bitter cost must not be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or another have had made themselves impossible at home, but who are thought to be quite good enough for the colonies. Such a policy ruins at the outset any chance of success. This holds true in small as well as large matters, because it is not only rising states that carry on a colonial policy; the urge to expand, with its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious undertaking.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_The finest clothes turn to rags.<br/>
Be careful all day long._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In a time of flowering culture, an occasional convulsion is bound to occur,uncovering a hidden evil within society and at first causing a great sensation. But since the situation is favorable on the whole, such evils can easily be glossed over and concealed from the public. Then everything is forgotten and peace apparently reigns complacently once more. However, to the thoughtful man, such occurrences are grave omens that he does not neglect.This is the only way of averting evil consequences.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox<br/>
Does not attain as much real happiness<br/>
As the neighbor in the west<br/>
With his small offering._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Religious attitudes are likewise influenced by the spiritual atmosphere prevailing in times after completion. In divine worship the simple old forms are replaced by an ever more elaborate ritual and an ever greater outward display. But inner seriousness is lacking in this show of magnificence; human caprice takes the place of conscientious obedience to the divine will.However, while man sees what is before his eyes, God looks into the heart.Therefore a simple sacrifice offered with real piety holds a greater blessing than an impressive service without warmth.

*** Six at the top means: ***

_He gets his head in the water.<br/>
Danger._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Here in conclusion another warning is added. After crossing a stream, aman's head can get into the water only if he is so imprudent as to turn back.As long as he goes forward and does not look back, he escapes this danger. But there is a fascination in standing still and looking back on a peril overcome.However, such vain self-admiration brings misfortune. It leads only to danger,and unless one finally resolves to go forward without pausing, one falls victim to this danger.
