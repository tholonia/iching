# <span style="color:gray">RETREAT /  TUN </span>
Hexagram: 33
Binary Sequence: 60 (111100)

* Upper trigram: 1 (7) CH'IEN / The Creative / Heaven

* Lower trigram: 3 (4) KeN / Keeping Still / Mountain

## <span style="brown:gray">Tholonic trigrams: </span>

### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (7) AIR / AIR is the symbol of a perfect yang state. AIR is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE. ( birth, exploration, imagination)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *AIR* represents the arena of growth and creation. What comes from the yin EARTH grows into the yang AIR. It holds all things in the Universe in place and is symbolic of spirit, which shows us a life beyond our mortal limitations.  It is cardinal, summer solstice, outward, the non-moving point between inflation and deflation. Instance of this are **birth**, **exploration**, **imagination**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yang state. AIR is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/> and RELEASING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the turning point from the internal journey to the external journey. This is the extreme yang pole, where the maximum point of COLLECTING is reached is reached and the RELEASING must soon begin.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> It is the nature of air to move and to create; it therefore seeks out the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> While the unknown is yin in nature, exploring it is yang, and it is only by exploring that definitions and limitations are discovered.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The contribution of AIR is to open new doors and find new horizons. 

### <span style="brown:gray">Lower </span>

* (4) Emptying / EMPTYING represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. EMPTYING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE. ( music, creation of the elements, heat)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. It is the final outward deflation that returns to the initial chaos from which everything is born. Instances of this are **music**, **creation of the elements**, **death**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the yin energy overtaking the center, making this trigram yin in nature. EMPTYING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> and EARTH <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style="width:20px"/> is one of final descension, or external yin, where the energy of FIRE quickly dies. This is external because it is FIRE transitioning to EARTH, and *descending* because the energy of creation is waning, but in the process matter is restructured (or born). This is the process that transforms energy to mass (*m=E/c^2^*).<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> In the dynamic between FIRE and EARTH, FIRE is always dependent on EARTH.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> FIRE can only find expression in EARTH, just like energy can only be experienced via matter. Therefore, the limitations on the expression of FIRE are determined by the yin quality of EARTH.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The restructuring of EARTH by FIRE is what brings everything into existence.



*** The Judgment: ***
RETREAT.<br/>
Success.<br/>
In what is small, perseverance furthers.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are advancing. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to be confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances,whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power and position. Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into a desperate life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not simply abandon the field to the opponent;we make it difficult for him to advance by showing perseverance in single acts of resistance. In this way we prepare, while retreating, for the countermovement. Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is not easy. The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT. Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
Not angrily but with reserve. The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally comes to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into the distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of the superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts as the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is a form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object. The superiorman shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior man to a standstill(mountain) by his dignified reserve.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_At the tail in retreat.<br/>
This is dangerous.<br/>
One must not wish to undertake anything._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Since the hexagram is the picture of something that is retreating, the lowest line represents the tail and the top line the head. In a retreat it is advantageous to be at the front. Here one is at the back, in immediate contact with the pursuing enemy. This is dangerous, and under such circumstances it is not advisable to undertake anything. Keeping still is the easiest way of escaping from the threatening danger.

*** Six in the second place means: ***

_he holds him fast with yellow oxhide,<br/>
No one can tear him loose._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Yellow is the color of the middle. It indicates that which is correct and inline with duty. Oxhide is strong and not to be torn. While the superior man retreat and the inferior press after them, the inferior man represented here holds on so firmly and tightly to the superior man that the latter cannot shake him off. And because he is in quest of what is right and so strong in purpose, he reaches his goal. Thus the line confirms what is said in the Judgment: "In what is small" --here equivalent to "in the inferior man" --"perseverance furthers."

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_A halted retreat<br/>
Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.<br/>
To retain people as men- and maidservants<br/>
Brings good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to be held back, because then one no longer has freedom of action. In such a case the only expedient is to take into one's service, so to speak, those who refuse to let one go, so that one may at least keep one's initiative and not fall helplessly under their domination. But even with this expedient the situation is far from satisfactory--for what can one hope to accomplish with such servants?

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man<br/>
And downfall to the inferior man._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In retreating the superior man is intent on taking his departure willingly and in all friendliness. He easily adjusts his mind to retreat, because in retreating he does not have to do violence to his convictions. The only one who suffers is the inferior man from whom he retreats, who will degenerate when deprived of the guidance of the superior man.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_Friendly retreat.<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
It is the business of the superior man to recognize in time that the moment of retreat has come. If the right moment is chosen, the retreat can be carried out within the forms of perfect friendliness, without the necessity of disagreeable discussions. Yet, for all the observance of amenities, absolute firmness of decision is necessary if one is not to be led astray by irrelevant considerations.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_Cheerful retreat.<br/>
Everything serves to further._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The situation is unequivocal. Inner detachment has become an established fact, and we are at liberty to depart. When one sees the way ahead thus clearly, free of all doubt, a cheerful mood sets in, and one chooses what is right without further thought. Such a clear path ahead always leads to thegood
