* (4) Emptying / EMPTYING represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. EMPTYING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE. ( music, creation of the elements, heat)

* *Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. It is the final outward deflation that returns to the initial chaos from which everything is born. Instances of this are **music**, **creation of the elements**, **death**.<br/>

The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> and EARTH <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style="width:20px"/> is one of final descension, or external yin, where the energy of FIRE quickly dies. This is external because it is FIRE transitioning to EARTH, and *descending* because the energy of creation is waning, but in the process matter is restructured (or born). This is the process that transforms energy to mass (*m=E/c^2^*).<br/>

*** The Judgment: ***
KEEPING STILL.<br/>
Keeping his back still<br/>
So that he no longer feels his body.<br/>
He goes into his courtyard<br/>
And does not see his people.<br/>
No blame.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
Truequiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still, and going forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest and movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there is light in life. The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement. The back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were. When a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He no longer sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever acts from these deep levels makes no mistakes.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Mountains standing close together: The image of KEEPING STILL. Thus the superior man Does not permit his thoughts

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
To go beyond his situation. The heart thinks constantly. This cannot be changed, but the movements of the heart-that is, a man's thoughts-should restrict themselves to the immediate situation. All thinking that goes beyond this only makes the heartsore.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_Keeping his toes still.<br/>
No blame.<br/>
Continued perseverance furthers._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Keeping the toes still means halting before one has even begun to move. The beginning is the time of few mistakes. At that time one is still in harmony with primal innocence. Not yet influenced by obscuring interests and desires,one sees things intuitively as they really are. A man who halts at the beginning, so long as he has not yet abandoned the truth, finds the right way.But persisting firmness is needed to keep one from drifting irresolutely.

*** Six in e second place means: ***

_Keeping his calves still,<br/>
He cannot rescue him whom he follows,<br/>
His heart is not glad._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The leg cannot move independently; it depends on the movement of the body.If a leg is suddenly stopped while the whole body is in vigorous motion, the continuing body movement will make one fall. The same is true of a man who serves a master stronger than himself. He is swept along, and even though he may himself halt on the path of wrongdoing, he can no longer check the other in his powerful movement. Where the master presses forward, the servant, no matter how good his intentions, cannot save him.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_Keeping his hips still.<br/>
Making his sacrum stiff.<br/>
Dangerous.<br/>
The heart suffocates._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This refers to enforced quiet. The restless heart is to be subdued by forcible means. But fire when it is smothered changes into acrid smoke that suffocates as it spreads. Therefore, in exercises in meditation and concentration, one ought not to try to force results. Rather, calmness must develop naturally out of a state of inner composure. If one tries to induce calmness by means of artificial rigidity, meditation will lead to very unwholesome results.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_Keeping his trunk still.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
As has been pointed out above in the comment on the Judgment, keeping the back at rest means forgetting the ego. This is the highest stage of rest. Here this stage has not yet been reached: the individual in this instance, though able to keep the ego, with its thoughts and impulses, in a state of rest, is not yet quite liberated from its dominance. Nonetheless, keeping the heart atrest is an important function, leading in the end to the complete elimination of egoistic drives. Even though at this point one does not yet remain free from all the dangers of doubt and unrest, this frame of mind is not a mistake,as it leads ultimately to that other, higher level.

*** Six in the fifth place means: ***

_Keeping his jaws still.<br/>
The words have order.<br/>
Remorse disappears._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A man in a dangerous situation, especially when he is not adequate to it, is inclined to be very free with talk and presumptuous jokes. But injudicious speech easily leads to situations that subsequently give much cause for regret. However, if a man is reserved in speech, his words take ever more definite form, and every occasion for regret vanishes.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_Noblehearted keeping still.<br/>
Good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This marks the consummation of the effort to attain tranquillity. One is atrest, not merely in a small, circumscribed way in regard to matters of detail,but one has also a general resignation in regard to life as a whole, and this confers peace and good fortune in relation to every individual matter.
