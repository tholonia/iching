### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *WATER* represents the movement from dark to light, yin to yang, lifelessness to life.  It is cardinal, spring equinox, ascending, the perfect balance of lessening yin and increasing yang. Instance of this are **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, **rivers**.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of WATER<img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of FILLING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/>and represents the balance between the yin and yang. that is achieved when yang penetrates the yin at is center. The oceans and lakes have filled and are stagnant until the rivers form which serves to collect the water to return it to its cycles..  It is the most *inward* moving of all the states.<br/>

<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> Water cedes to whatever holds it.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The movement of water is what gives it it power.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> it is the yielding quality of water that is its contributions.

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *AIR* represents the arena of growth and creation. What comes from the yin EARTH grows into the yang AIR.

It is cardinal, summer solstice, outward, the non-moving point between inflation and deflation. Instance of this are **birth**, **exploration**, **imagination**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yang state. AIR is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/> and RELEASING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the turning point from the internal journey to the external journey. This is the extreme yang pole, where the maximum point of COLLECTING is reached is reached and the RELEASING must soon begin.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> It is the nature of air to move and to create; it therefore seeks out the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> While the unknown is yin in nature, exploring it is yang, and it is only by exploring that definitions and limitations are discovered.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The contribution of AIR is to open new doors and find new horizons. 



*** The Judgment: ***
WAITING.<br/>
If you are sincere,<br/>
You have light and success.<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br/>
It furthers one to cross the great water.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross the great water--that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Clouds rise up to heaven: The image of WAITING. Thus the superior man eats and drinks, and is joyous and of good cheer.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
When clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain. There is nothing to do but to wait until after the rain falls. It is the same in life when destiny is at work. We should not worry and seek to shape the future by interfering in things before the time is ripe. We should quietly fortify the body with food and drink and the mind with gladness and good cheer. Fate comes when it will, and thus we are ready.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Nine at the beginning means: ***

_Waiting in the meadow.<br/>
It furthers one to abide in what endures.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The danger is not yet close. One is still waiting on the open plain. Conditions are still simple, yet there is a feeling of something impending. One must continue to lead a regular life as long as possible. Only in this way does one guard against a premature waste of strength, keep free of blame and error that would become a source of weakness later on.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_Waiting on the sand,<br/>
There is some gossip,<br/>
The end brings good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The danger gradually comes closer. Sand is near the bank of the river, and the water means danger. Disagreements crop up. General unrest can easily develop in such times, and we lay the blame on one another. He who stays calm will succeed in making things go well in the end. Slander will be silenced if we do not gratify it with injured retorts.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_Waiting in the mud<br/>
Brings about the arrival of the enemy._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Mud is no place for waiting since it is already being washed by the water of the stream. Instead of having gathered strength to cross the stream at one try, one has made a premature start that has got him no farther than the muddy bank. Such an unfavorable position invites enemies from without, who naturally take advantage of it. Caution and a sense of the seriousness of the situation are all that can keep one from injury.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_Waiting in blood.<br/>
Get out of the pit._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The situation is extremely dangerous. It is of utmost gravity now--a matter of life and death. Bloodshed seems imminent. There is no going forward or backward; we are cut off as if in a pit. Now we must simply stand fast and let fate take its course. This composure, which keeps us from aggravating the trouble by anything we might do, is the only way of getting out of the dangerous pit.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_Waiting at meat and drink.<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br/>
Even in the midst of danger, there come intervals of peace when things go relatively well.<br/>
If we possess enough inner strength, we shall take advantage of these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle.<br/>
We must know how to enjoy the moment without being deflected from the goal, for perseverance is needed to remain victorious.<br/>
This is true in public life as well; it is not possible to achieve everything all at once.<br/>
The height of wisdom is to allow people enough recreation to quicken pleasure in their work until the task is completed.<br/>
Herein lies the secret of the whole hexagram.<br/>
It differs from<br/>
ChinOBSTRUCTION_

*** Commentary on the line ***
39, in the fact that in this instance, while waiting, we are sure of our cause and therefore do not lose the serenity born of inner cheerfulness.

*** Six at the top means: ***

_One falls into the pit.<br/>
Three uninvited guests arrive.<br/>
Honor them, and in the end, there will be good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into the pit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been in vain. But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn. Without a move on one's own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form that at first seems strange to us.
