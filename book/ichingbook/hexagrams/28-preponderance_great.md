* (3) Collecting / COLLECTING represents the higher orders of structure that extend ever outward ( Internet, space-born viruses, Mongol Empire)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Collecting* represents the higher orders of structure that extend ever outward. It is the final internal inflation, the final preparation.  Instances of this are the **Internet**, **space-born viruses**, **Mongol Empire** .<br/>
<br/>
This trigram, with two emerging yang lines, is now in the domain of the yang.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of WATER <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of preparing, or internal yang, where the balanced state of WATER ascends and expands into the polar state of AIR.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang becomes dominant here, and the remaining yin is outnumbered. This is the time when the yang begins to reign.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang is no longer constrained by the limitation of the EARTH and is free to expand into what seems like limitless AIR.  This is the culmination of expression, and whatever the ultimate expression of an instance is, according to the nature of the instance, will be expressed here. <br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> What remains of that expression or how it lives on is something only history will know.

* (6) Release / RELEASE represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient ( lightening, Big Bang, inspiration)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Release* represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. expression of Instance of this are **lightening**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest place of 1, beginning, birth, plant, idea.  The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> and FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of outward descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction.  When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE.  The process of *release* is defined by the three states of trigram 6.  This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world.  *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point.  Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushed against the limitations of the yin.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang finds expression in FIRE, even if at the cost of the yin.  <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.<br/>
The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.<br/>
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br/>
Success.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
The weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the strength of the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests, sags to the breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for the load they bear. It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore extraordinary measures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of transition as quickly as possible, and to take action. This promises success. For although the strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared. Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures. The problem must be solved by gently penetration to the meaning of the situation (as is suggested by the attribute of the inner trigram, Sun); then the change-over to other conditions will be successful. It demands real superiority; therefore the time when the great preponderates is a momentous time.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
The lake rises above the trees: The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.Thus the superior man, when he stands alone, Is unconcerned, And if he has to renounce the world, He is undaunted.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times when the lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are temporary. The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times: the symbol of the trigram Sun is the tree, which stands firm even though it stands alone,and the attribute of Tui is joyousness, which remains undaunted even if it must renounce the world.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_To spread white rushes underneath.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
When a man wishes to undertake an enterprise in extraordinary times, he must be extraordinarily cautious, just as when setting a heavy thing down on the floor, one takes care to put rushes under it, so that nothing will break. This caution, though it may seem exaggerated, is not a mistake. Exceptional enterprises cannot succeed unless utmost caution is observed in their beginnings and in the laying of their foundations.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_A dry poplar sprouts at the root,<br/>
An older man takes a young wife,<br/>
Everything furthers._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Wood is near water; hence the image of an old poplar sprouting at the root.This means an extraordinary situation arises when an older man marries a young girl who suits him. Despite the unusualness of the situation, all goes well.From the point of view of politics, the meaning is that in exceptional times one does well to join with the lowly, for this affords a possibility of renewal.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.<br/>
Misfortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This indicates a type of man who in times of preponderance of the great insists on pushing ahead. He accepts no advice from others, and therefore they in turn are not willing to lend him support. Because of this the burden grows,until the structure of things bends or breaks. Plunging willfully ahead in times of danger only hastens the catastrophe.

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_The ridgepole is braced.<br/>
Good fortune.<br/>
If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Through friendly relations with people of lower rank, a responsible man succeeds in becoming master of the situation. But if, instead of working for the rescue of the whole, he were to misuse his connections to obtain personal power and success, it would lead to humiliation.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_A withered poplar puts forth flowers.<br/>
An older woman takes a husband.<br/>
No blame.<br/>
No praise._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A withered poplar that flowers exhausts its energies thereby and only hastens its end. An older woman may marry once more, but no renewal takes place. Everything remains barren. Thus, though all the amenities are observed,the net result is only the anomaly of the situation. Applied to politics, the metaphor means that if in times of insecurity we give up alliance with those below us and keep up only the relationships we have with people of higher rank, an unstable situation is created.

*** Six at the top means: ***

_One must go through the water.<br/>
It goes over one's head.<br/>
Misfortune.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Here is a situation in which the unusual has reached a climax. One is courageous and wishes to accomplish one's task, no matter what happens. This leads into danger. The water rises over one's head. This is the misfortune.But one incurs no blame in giving up one's life that the good and the right may prevail. There are things that are more important than life.
