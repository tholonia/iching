* (4) Emptying / EMPTYING represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. EMPTYING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE. ( music, creation of the elements, heat)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. It is the final outward deflation that returns to the initial chaos from which everything is born. Instances of this are **music**, **creation of the elements**, **death**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the yin energy overtaking the center, making this trigram yin in nature. EMPTYING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> and EARTH <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style="width:20px"/> is one of final descension, or external yin, where the energy of FIRE quickly dies. This is external because it is FIRE transitioning to EARTH, and *descending* because the energy of creation is waning, but in the process matter is restructured (or born). This is the process that transforms energy to mass (*m=E/c^2^*).<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> In the dynamic between FIRE and EARTH, FIRE is always dependent on EARTH.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> FIRE can only find expression in EARTH, just like energy can only be experienced via matter. Therefore, the limitations on the expression of FIRE are determined by the yin quality of EARTH.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The restructuring of EARTH by FIRE is what brings everything into existence.

* (6) Release / RELEASE represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient ( lightening, Big Bang, inspiration)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Release* represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. expression of Instance of this are **lightening**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest place of 1, beginning, birth, plant, idea.  The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> and FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of outward descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction.  When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE.  The process of *release* is defined by the three states of trigram 6.  This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world.  *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point.  Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushed against the limitations of the yin.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang finds expression in FIRE, even if at the cost of the yin.  <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED Has supreme success.<br/>
It furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>
Before the starting point, three days.<br/>
After the starting point, three days.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
What has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again through man's work. IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom. Work Toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the possibilities of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-symbolized by crossing of the great water-but must take hold energetically. Success depends, however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines,"Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days."We must first know the cause of corruption before we can do away with them;hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the start. Then we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that a relapse maybe avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time after the start.Decisiveness and energy must take the place of inertia and indifference that have led to decay, in order that the ending may be followed by a new beginning.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
The wind blows low on the mountain: The image of DECAY. Thus the superior man stirs up the people And strengthens their spirit.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
When the wind blows slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils the vegetation. This contains a challenge to improvement. It is the same with debasing attitudes and fashions; they corrupt human society. His methods likewise must be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a way that their effects unfold in orderly sequence. The superior must first remove stagnation by stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs up everything, and must strengthen and tranquilize the character of the people, as the mountain gives tranquillity and nourishment to all that grows in its vicinity.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six in the beginning means: ***

_Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br/>
If there is a son, No blame rests upon the departed father.<br/>
Danger.<br/>
In the end good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Rigid adherence to tradition has resulted in decay. But the decay has not yet penetrated deeply and so can still be easily remedied. It is as if a son were compensated for the decay his father allowed to creep in. Then no blame attaches to the father. However, one must not overlook the danger or take the matter too lightly. Only if one is conscious of the danger connected with every reform will everything go well in the end.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother,<br/>
One must not be too persevering._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This refers to mistakes that as a result of weakness have brought about decay-hence the symbol, "what has been spoiled by the mother. " In setting things right in such a case, a certain gentle consideration is called for. In order not to wound, one should not attempt to proceed too drastically.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br/>
There will be a little remorse.<br/>
No great blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This describes a man who proceeds a little too energetically in righting the mistakes of the past. Now and then, as a result, minor discourse and annoyances will surely develop. But too much energy is better than too little.Therefore, although he may at times have slight cause for regret, he remains free of any serious blame.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father.<br/>
In continuing one sees humiliation._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This shows the situation of someone too weak to take measures against decay that has its roots in the past and is just beginning to manifest itself. It is allowed to run its course. If this continues, humiliation will result.

*** Six in the fifth place means: ***

_Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br/>
One meets with praise._

*** Commentary on the line ***
An individual is confronted with corruption originating from neglect in former times. He lacks the power to ward it off alone, but with able help she can at least bring about a thorough reform, if he cannot create a new beginning, and this also is praiseworthy.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_He does not serve kings and princes,<br/>
Sets himself higher goals._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Not every man has an obligation to mingle in the affairs of the world. There are some who are developed to such a degree that they are justified in letting the world go its own way and refusing to enter public life with a view to reforming it. But this does not imply a right to remain idle or to sit back and merely criticize. Such withdrawal is justified only when we strive to realize in ourselves the higher aims of mankind. For although the sage remains distant from the turmoil of daily life, he creates incomparable human values for the future.
