*** The Judgment: ***
POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.<br/>
Supreme success.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is it possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast and to possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is favorable--a time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power is expressing itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme success and wealth.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Fire in heaven above: The image of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE. Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good, And thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
The sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth, is the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this sort must be administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good into the light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor and promote the good.Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will of God, who desires only good and not evil.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Nine at the beginning means: ***

_No relationship with what is harmful; <br/>
There is no blame in this.<br/>
If one remains conscious of difficulty, <br/>
One remains without blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Great possession that is still in its beginnings and that has not yet been challenged brings no blame, since there has been no opportunity to make mistakes. Yet there are many difficulties to be overcome. It is only by remaining conscious of theses difficulties that one can keep inwardly free of possible arrogance and wastefulness, and thus in principle overcome all cause for blame.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_A big wagon for loading,<br/>
One may undertake something,<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Great possession consists not only in the quantity of goods at one's disposal, but first and foremost, in their mobility and utility, for then they can be used in undertakings, and we remain free of embarrassment and mistakes.The big wagon, which will carry a heavy load and in which one can journey far means that there are at hand able helpers who give their support t and are equal to their task. One can load great responsibility upon such persons, and this is necessary in important undertakings.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven.<br/>
A petty man cannot do this._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what he possesses as his exclusive personal property , but should place it at the disposal of the ruler or of the people at large. In so doing, he takes the right attitude toward his possession, which as private property can never endure. A petty man is incapable of this. He is harmed by great possessions, because instead of sacrificing them, he would keep them for himself.

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_He makes a difference<br/>
Between himself and his neighbor.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This characterizes the position of a man placed among rich and powerful neighbors. It is a dangerous position. He must look neither to the right nor to the left, and must shun envy and the temptation to vie with others. In this way he remains free of mistakes.

*** Six in the fifth place means: ***

_He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified,<br/>
Has good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The situation is very favorable. People are being won not by coercion but by unaffected sincerity, so that they are attached to us in sincerity and truth.However, benevolence alone is not sufficient at the time of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE. For insolence might begin to spread. Insolence must be kept in bounds by dignity; then good fortune is assured.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_He is blessed by heaven.<br/>
Good fortune.<br/>
Nothing that does not further.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
In the fullness of possession and at the height of power, one remains modest and gives honor to the sage who stands outside the affairs of the world. By this means one puts oneself under the beneficent influence descending from heaven, and all goes well. <br/>
<br/>
Confucius says of this line: To bless means to help. Heaven helps the man who is devoted; men help the man who is true. He who walks in truth and is devoted in his thinking, and furthermore reveres the worthy, is blessed by heaven. He has good fortune, and there is nothing that would not further.
