Hexagram: 37
Binary Sequence: 53 (110101)

* Upper trigram: 5 (6) SUN / The Gentle / Wind & Wood

* Lower trigram: 6 (5) LI / The Clinging / Fire

## <span style="brown:gray">Tholonic trigrams: </span>

### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (6) Release / RELEASE represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient ( lightening, Big Bang, inspiration)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Release* represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. expression of Instance of this are **lightening**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest place of 1, beginning, birth, plant, idea.  The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> and FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of outward descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction.  When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE.  The process of *release* is defined by the three states of trigram 6.  This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world.  *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point.  Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushed against the limitations of the yin.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang finds expression in FIRE, even if at the cost of the yin.  <br/>


### <span style="brown:gray">Lower </span>

* (5) FIRE / FIRE is the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes. ( energy, heat,light)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *FIRE* represents the quality that allow for manifestation, transforming idea to form. It is cardinal, fall equinox, descending, the perfect balance of lessening yang and increasing yin. Instance of this are **light**, **consumption**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of RELEASE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and EMPTYING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the dissipation of energy, which bring form in to existence and light into the world. This is the balanced that represents the hight of outward expression.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang is built up and is ready to be released.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The yin returns as the yang is released, which is defined by dissipation and entropy.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The energy is shared with the world, as light, heat, and movement. <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
THE FAMILY.<br/>
The perseverance of the woman furthers.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
The foundation of the family is the relationship between husband and wife.The tie that hold the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. The tie that holds the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. Her place is within (second line), while that of the husband is without (fifth line). It is in accord with the great laws of nature that husband and wife take their proper places. Within the family a strong authority is needed; this is represented by the parents. If the father is really a father and the son a son, if the elder brother fulfills his position,and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really a husband and the wife a wife, then the family is in order. When the family is in order, all the social relationships of mankind will be in order. Three of the five social relationships are to be found within the family-that between father and son,which is the relation of love, that between the husband and wife, which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that between elder and younger brother, which is the relation of correctness. The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness to duty; the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the form of deference. The family is society in the embryo; it is the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made early through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this was later widened to include human relationships in general.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Wind comes forth from fire: The image of THE FAMILY.Thus the superior man has substance in his words And duration in his way of life.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the fire and issuing forth form it. This represents influence working from within outward. The same thing is needed in the regulation of the family. Here to the influence on others must proceed from one's own person. In order to be capable of producing such an influence, one's words must have power, and this they can have only if they are based on something real, just as flame dependson its fuel Words have influence only when they are pertinent and clearly related to definite circumstances. General discourses and admonitions have no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by one's entire conduct, just as the wind is made effective by am impression on others that they can adapt and conform to it. If words and conduct are not in accord and consistent, they will have no effect.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Nine at the beginning means: ***

_Firm seclusion within the family.<br/>
Remorse disappears._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The family must form a well-defined unit within which each member knows his place. From the beginning each child must be accustomed to firmly established rules of order, before ever its will is directed to other things. If we begin too late to enforce order, when the will of the child has already been overindulged, the whims and passions, grown stronger with the years, offer resistance and give cause for remorse. If we insist on order from the outset,occasions for remorse may arise-in general social life these are unavoidable-but the remorse always disappears again, and everything rights itself. For there is nothing easily avoided and more difficult to carry through than"breaking a child's will."

*** Six in the second place means: ***

_She should not follow her whims,<br/>
She must attend within to the food,<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The wife must always be guided by the will of the master of the house, be he father, husband, or grown son. There, without having to look for them, she has great and important duties. She must attend to the nourishment of her family and to the food for the sacrifice. IN this way she becomes the center of the social and religious life of the family, and her perseverance in this position brings good fortune to the whole house. In relation to general conditions, the counsel here is to seek nothing by means of force, but quietly to confine oneself to the duties at hand.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_When tempers flare up in the family.<br/>
Too great severity brings remorse.<br/>
Good fortune nonetheless.<br/>
When woman and chile dally and laugh<br/>
It leads in the end to humiliation._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In the family the proper mean between severity and indulgence ought to prevail. Too great severity toward one's own flesh and blood leads to remorse.The wise thing is to build strong dikes within which complete freedom of movement is allowed each individual. But in doubtful instances too great severity, despite occasional mistakes, is preferable, because it preserves discipline in the family, whereas too great weakness leads to disgrace.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_She is the treasure of the house.<br/>
Great good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
It is upon the woman of the house that the well-being of the family depends.Well-being prevails when expenditures and income are soundly balanced. This leads to great good fortune. In the sphere of public life, this line refers to the faithful steward whose measures further the general welfare.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_As a king he approaches his family.<br/>
Fear not.<br/>
Good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A king is the symbol of a fatherly man who is richly endowed in mind. He does nothing to make himself feared; on the contrary, the whole family can trust him, because love governs their intercourse. His character of itself exercises the right influence.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_His work commands respect.<br/>
In the end good fortune comes._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In the last analysis, order within the family depends on the character of the master of the house. If he cultivates his personality so that it works impressively through the force of inner truth, all goes well with the family.In a ruling position one must of his own accord assume responsibility.
