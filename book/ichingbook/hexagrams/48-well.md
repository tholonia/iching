### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (2) WATER / WATER is the symbol of yang energy penetrating the yin at its core.  ( movement, nouirishment)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *WATER* represents the movement from dark to light, yin to yang, lifelessness to life.  It is cardinal, spring equinox, ascending, the perfect balance of lessening yin and increasing yang. Instance of this are **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, **rivers**.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of WATER<img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of FILLING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/>and represents the balance between the yin and yang. that is achieved when yang penetrates the yin at is center. The oceans and lakes have filled and are stagnant until the rivers form which serves to collect the water to return it to its cycles..  It is the most *inward* moving of all the states.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yang energy penetrating the yin at its core. <br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> Water cedes to whatever holds it.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The movement of water is what gives it it power.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> it is the yielding quality of water that is its contributions. If always follows the path of least resistance, is used by every form of life and Nature itself, and is then returned, essentially unchanged. It takes nothing, and gives everything.

* (6) Release / RELEASE represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient ( lightening, Big Bang, inspiration)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Release* represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. expression of Instance of this are **lightening**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest place of 1, beginning, birth, plant, idea.  The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> and FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of outward descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction.  When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE.  The process of *release* is defined by the three states of trigram 6.  This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world.  *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point.  Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushed against the limitations of the yin.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang finds expression in FIRE, even if at the cost of the yin.  <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
THE WELL.<br/>
The town may be changed,<br/>
But the well cannot be changed.<br/>
It neither decreases nor increases.<br/>
They come and go and draw from the well.<br/>
If one gets down almost to the water<br/>
And the rope does not go all the way,<br/>
Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. The Style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of thewell has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political Structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. It grows neither less not more; it exists for one and for all. The generations come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance. However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. Carelessness-by which the jug is broken-is also disastrous. If for instance the military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug. This hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone.And every human being can draw in the course of his education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man's nature. But here likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention-a partial education of this sort is as bad as none- or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self-development.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Water over wood: the image of THE WELL. Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work, And exhorts them to help one another.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above it.Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the action of the well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior man organizes human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts co-operate for the benefit of the whole.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_One does not drink the mud of the well.<br/>
No animals come to an old well._

*** Commentary on the line ***
If a man wanders around in swampy lowlands, his life is submerged in mud.Such a man loses all significance for mankind. He who throws himself away is no longer sought out by others. In the end no one troubles about him any more.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_At the well hole one shoots fishes._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The jug is broken and leaks. The water itself is clear, but it is not being used. Thus the well is a place where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes only to catch fish. But the jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be kept in it. This describes the situation of a person who possesses good qualities but neglects them. No one bothers about him. As a result he deteriorates in mind. He associates with inferior men and can no longer accomplish anything worthwhile.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.<br/>
This is my heart's sorrow.<br/>
For one might draw from it.<br/>
If the king were clear-minded.<br/>
Good fortune might be enjoyed in common._

*** Commentary on the line ***
An able man is available. He is like a purified well whose water is drinkable. But no use is made of him. This is the sorrow of those who know him. One wishes that the prince might learn about it; this would be good fortune for all concerned.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_The well is being lined.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
True, if a well is being lined with stone, it cannot be used while the work is going on. But the work is not in vain; the result is that the water stays clear. In life also there are times when a man must put himself in order.During such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is nonetheless valuable, because by enhancing his powers and abilities through inner development, he can accomplish all the more later on.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_In the well there is a clear, cold spring<br/>
From which one can drink._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well. A man who has virtues like a well of this sort is born to be a leader and savior of men, forhe has the water of life. Nevertheless, the character for "good fortune" is left out here. The all-important thing about a well is that its water be drawn. The best water is only a potentiality for refreshment as long as it is not brought up. So too with leaders of mankind: it is all-important that one should drink from the spring of their words and translate them into life.

*** Six at the top means: ***

_One draws from the well<br/>
Without hindrance.<br/>
It is dependable.<br/>
Supreme good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The well is there fore all. No one is forbidden to take water from it. No matter how many come, all find what they need, for the well is dependable. It has a spring and never runs dry. Therefore it is a great blessing to the whole land. The same is true of the really great man, whose inner wealth is inexhaustible; the more that people draw from him, the greater his wealth becomes.
