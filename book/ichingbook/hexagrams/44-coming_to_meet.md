## <span style="brown:gray">Tholonic trigrams: </span>

### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (7) AIR / AIR is the symbol of a perfect yang state. AIR is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE. ( birth, exploration, imagination)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *AIR* represents the arena of growth and creation. What comes from the yin EARTH grows into the yang AIR. It holds all things in the Universe in place and is symbolic of spirit, which shows us a life beyond our mortal limitations.  It is cardinal, summer solstice, outward, the non-moving point between inflation and deflation. Instance of this are **birth**, **exploration**, **imagination**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yang state. AIR is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/> and RELEASING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the turning point from the internal journey to the external journey. This is the extreme yang pole, where the maximum point of COLLECTING is reached is reached and the RELEASING must soon begin.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> It is the nature of air to move and to create; it therefore seeks out the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> While the unknown is yin in nature, exploring it is yang, and it is only by exploring that definitions and limitations are discovered.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The contribution of AIR is to open new doors and find new horizons. 

### <span style="brown:gray">Lower </span>

* (6) Release / RELEASE represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient ( lightening, Big Bang, inspiration)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Release* represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. expression of Instance of this are **lightening**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest place of 1, beginning, birth, plant, idea.  The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> and FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of outward descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction.  When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE.  The process of *release* is defined by the three states of trigram 6.  This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world.  *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point.  Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushed against the limitations of the yin.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang finds expression in FIRE, even if at the cost of the yin.  <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
COMING TO MEET.<br/>
The maiden is powerful.<br/>
One should not marry such a maiden.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of a bold girl who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power. This would not be possible if the strong and light-giving element had not, in turn, come halfway.The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it; it looks so small and weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to no harm. The inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him as dangerous and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the fist, he could never gain influence. The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way. Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise, harm will result.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Under heaven, wind: The image of COMING TO MEET. Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
The situation here resembles that in hexagram 20, Kuan, CONTEMPLATION (VIEW). In the latter the wind blows over the earth, here it blows under heaven; in both cases, it goes everywhere. There the wind is on the earth and symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom; here the wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by the ruler through his commands. Heaven is far from the things of earth, but it sets them in motion by means of the wind. The ruler is far formed his people, but he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_It must be checked with a brake of bronze.<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br/>
If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.<br/>
Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around._

*** Commentary on the line ***
If an inferior element has wormed its way in, it must be energetically checked at once. By consistently checking it, bad effects can be avoided. If it is allowed to take its course, misfortune is bound to result; the insignificance of that which creeps in should not be a temptation to underrated. A pig that is still young and lean cannot rage around much, but after it has eaten its fill and become strong, its true nature comes out if it has not previously been curbed.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_There is a fish in the tank,<br/>
No blame,<br/>
Does not further guests._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The inferior element is not overcome by violence but is kept under gentle control. Then nothing evil is to be feared. But care must be taken not to let it come in contact with those further away because once free it would unfold its evil aspects unchecked.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_There is no skin on his thighs.<br/>
And walking comes hard.<br/>
If one is mindful of the danger.<br/>
No great mistake is made._

*** Commentary on the line ***
There is a temptation to fall in with the evil element offering itself-a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, circumstances prevent this; one would like to do it, but cannot. This leads to painful indecision in behavior. But if we gain clear insight into the danger of the situation, we shall at least avoid more serious mistakes.

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_No fish in the tank.<br/>
This leads to misfortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Insignificant people must be tolerated in order to keep them well disposed.Then we can make use of them if we should need them. If we become alienated from them and do not meet them halfway, they turn their backs on us and are not at our disposal when we need them. But this is our own fault.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_A melon covered with willow leaves.<br/>
Hidden lines.<br/>
Then it drops down to one from heave._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The melon, like the fish, is a symbol of the principle of darkness. It is sweet but spoils easily and for this reason, is protected with a cover of willow leaves. This is a situation in which a strong, superior, well-poised man tolerates and protects the inferiors in his charge. He has the firm lines of order and beauty within himself but he does not lay stress upon them. He does not bother his subordinates with outward show or tiresome admonitions but leaves them quite free, putting his trust in the transforming power of a strong and upright personality. And behold! Fate is favorable. His interiors respond to his influence and fall to his disposition like ripe fruit.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_He comes to meet with his horns.<br/>
Humiliation.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
When a man has withdrawn from the world, its tumult often becomes unbearable to him. There are many people who in a noble pride hold themselves aloof from all that is low and rebuff it brusquely wherever it comes to meet them. Such persons are reproached for being proud and distant, but since active duties no longer hold them to the world, this does not greatly matter. They know how to beat the dislike of the masses with composure.
