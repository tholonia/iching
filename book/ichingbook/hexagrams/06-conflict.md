<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/> and RELEASING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the turning point from the internal journey to the external journey. This is the extreme yang pole, where the maximum point of COLLECTING is reached is reached and the RELEASING must soon begin.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> It is the nature of air to move and to create; it therefore seeks out the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> While the unknown is yin in nature, exploring it is yang, and it is only by exploring that definitions and limitations are discovered.<br/>

2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The movement of water is what gives it it power.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> it is the yielding quality of water that is its contributions. If always follows the path of least resistance, is used by every form of life and Nature itself, and is then returned, essentially unchanged. It takes nothing, and gives everything.



*** The Judgment: ***
CONFLICT.<br/>
You are sincere<br/>
And are being obstructed.<br/>
A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br/>
Going through to the end brings misfortune.<br/>
It furthers one to see the great man.<br/>
It does not further one to cross the great water.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict. If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has evil effects even when one is the right because the enmity is then perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to conquer danger without.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Heaven and water go their opposite ways: The image of CONFLICT. Thus in all his transactions the superior man Carefully considers the beginning.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
The image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the opposing tendencies of the two trigrams. Once these opposing tendencies appear, conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be taken carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties are exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_If one does not perpetuate the affair, <br/>
There is a little gossip.<br/>
In the end, good fortune comes._

*** Commentary on the line ***
While a conflict is in the incipient stage, the best thing To do is to drop the issue. Especially when the adversary is stronger, it is not advisable to risk pushing the conflict to a decision. It may come to a slight dispute, but in the end all goes well.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_One cannot engage in conflict,<br/>
One returns home, gives way,<br/>
The people of his town,<br/>
Three hundred households,<br/>
Remain free of guilt._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace. Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. If out of a false sense of honor, a man allowed himself to be tempted into an unequal conflict, he would be drawing down disaster upon himself. In such a case a wise and conciliatory attitude benefits the whole community, which will then not be drawn into the conflict.

*** Six in the third place means: ***

_To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.<br/>
Danger.<br/>
In the end, good fortune comes.<br/>
If by chance you are in the service of a king.<br/>
Seek not works._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition. Only that which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanent possession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but since it is really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man possesses through the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one enters the service of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking works for the sake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go to the other.

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_One cannot engage in conflict.<br/>
One turns back and submits to fate.<br/>
Changes one's attitude.<br/>
And finds peace in perseverance.<br/>
Good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This refers to a person whose inner attitude at first lacks peace. He doesn't feel content with his situation and would like to improve it through conflict. In contrast to the situation of the nine in the second place, he is dealing with a weaker opponent and might therefore succeed. But he cannot carry on the fight, because, since right is not on his side, he cannot justify the conflict to his conscience. Therefore he turns back and accepts his fate. He changes his mind and finds lasting peace in being at one with eternal law. This brings good fortune.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_To contend before him<br/>
Brings supreme good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This refers to an arbiter in a conflict who is powerful and just, and strong enough to lend weight to the right side. A dispute can be turned over to him with confidence. If one is in the right, one attains great good fortune.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one.<br/>
By the end of a morning<br/>
It will have been snatched away three times._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Here we have someone who has carried a conflict to the bitter end and has triumphed. He is granted a decoration, but his happiness does not last. He is attacked again and again, and the result is conflict without end.
