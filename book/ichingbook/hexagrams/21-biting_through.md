## <span style="brown:gray">Tholonic trigrams: </span>

### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (5) FIRE / FIRE is the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes. ( energy, heat,light)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *FIRE* represents the quality that allow for manifestation, transforming idea to form. It is cardinal, fall equinox, descending, the perfect balance of lessening yang and increasing yin. Instance of this are **light**, **consumption**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of RELEASE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and EMPTYING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the dissipation of energy, which bring form in to existence and light into the world. This is the balanced that represents the hight of outward expression.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang is built up and is ready to be released.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The yin returns as the yang is released, which is defined by dissipation and entropy.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The energy is shared with the world, as light, heat, and movement. <br/>


### <span style="brown:gray">Lower </span>

* (1) Filling / FILLING represents form coming to life. FILLING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE. ( gestation, dark matter (expansion of the Universe), artificial intelligence)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Filling* represents form coming to life.  It is the initial inward inflation of a new cycle. Instance of this are **gestation**, **dark matter (expansion of the Universe)**, **artificial intelligence**.<br/>
<br/>
This trigram shows the return of the yang energy in the bottom place, but as the center is still yin, it is in the domain of yin. FILLING is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of EARTH <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style="width:20px"/> and WATER <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> is one of new beginnings, or internal yin, where the empty yin state of EARTH begins to return to life with energy.   It is inward because the yang enters from the lowest place, and ascending because the yang continues to rise.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The lack of yang is what draws the yang to penetrate the EARTH<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang must fill the empty yin vessel of EARTH before it can express itself.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The omnipresence of yang is the universal reservoir that can be tapped into from anywhere, not unlike the idea of the earth as the electrical ground for all electronics.



*** The Judgment: ***
BITING THROUGH has success.<br/>
It is favorable to let justice be administered.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success. This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it. However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines Li, clarity, and Chen, excitement. Li is yielding, Chen is hard. Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two together create the just measure. It is of this moment that the man who makes the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by his conduct in his position.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Thunder and lightning: The image of BITING THROUGH. Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws Through clearly defined penalties.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws specify the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes. This is symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened by a just application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror of thunder. This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves. The Obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them. The only to strengthen the law is to make it clear and make penalties certain and swift.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Nine at the beginning means: ***

_His feet are fastened in the stocks, <br/>
So that his toes disappear.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong, the penalty is a mild one. Only the toes are put in the stocks. This prevents him from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame. It is a warning to halt in time on the path of evil.

*** Six in the second place means: ***

_Bites through tender meat,<br/>
So that his nose disappears,<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case; it is like biting through tender meat. But one encounters a hardened sinner, and, aroused by anger, one goes a little too far. The disappearance of the nose in the course of the bite signifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility. However, there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such is just.

*** Six in the third place means: ***

_Bites on old dried meat<br/>
And strikes on something poisonous.<br/>
Slight humiliation.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and authority to do so. Therefore the culprits do not submit. The matter at issue is an old one-as symbolized by salted game-and in dealing with it difficulties arise. This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the problem the punisher arouses poisonous hatred against himself, and in this way is put in a somewhat humiliating position. But since punishment was required by the time, he remains free of blame.

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_Bites on dried gristly meat.<br/>
Receives metal arrows.<br/>
It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties<br/>
And to be persevering.<br/>
Good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to be punished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is necessary to be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties. If one knows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good fortune. The difficult task is achieved in the end.

*** Six in the fifth place means: ***

_Bites on dried lean meat.<br/>
Receives yellow gold.<br/>
Perseveringly aware of danger.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear. Since we naturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like yellow-gold, that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the color of the middle [the mean]. It is only by remaining conscious of the dangers growing out of the responsibility we have assumed that we can avoid making mistakes.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,<br/>
So that his ears disappear.<br/>
Misfortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who is incorrigible. His punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears disappear under it-that is to say, he is deaf to warnings. This obstinacy leads to misfortune.
