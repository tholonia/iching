* Upper trigram: 6 (5) LI / The Clinging / Fire

* Lower trigram: 7 (0) K'UN / The Receptive / Earth

## <span style="brown:gray">Tholonic trigrams: </span>

### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (5) FIRE / FIRE is the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes. ( energy, heat,light)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *FIRE* represents the quality that allow for manifestation, transforming idea to form. It is cardinal, fall equinox, descending, the perfect balance of lessening yang and increasing yin. Instance of this are **light**, **consumption**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a yang on the outsides but dependent on a yin center, as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of RELEASE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style="width:20px"/> and EMPTYING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the dissipation of energy, which bring form in to existence and light into the world. This is the balanced that represents the hight of outward expression.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang is built up and is ready to be released.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The yin returns as the yang is released, which is defined by dissipation and entropy.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The energy is shared with the world, as light, heat, and movement. <br/>


### <span style="brown:gray">Lower </span>

* (0) EARTH / EARTH is  the symbol of a perfect yin state. ( foundation, resources)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *EARTH* represents the foundation upon which everything is built as well as the resources from which they are built. It is cardinal, winter solstice, inward, the non-moving point between deflation and inflation.  Instance of this are **resources**, **foundations**, **support**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yin state.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of EARTH <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of EMPTYING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style="width:20px"/> and FILLING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and therefore represent the extreme yin pole, where the maximum point of EMPTYING is reached and where FILLING begins. <br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> A yin here indicates that anything can be negotiated, for it is receptive to anything, yin or yang.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The emerging definitions are determined by the whatever is acting upon it.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> The contribution of the yin is that is allows a yang to appear simply by its existence. It doesn't need to do anything, just as 0 implies 1 by its nothingness. <br/>




*** The Judgment: ***
PROGRESS.<br/>
The powerful prince<br/>
Is honored with horses in large numbers.<br/>
In a single day he is granted audience three times.<br/>



*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal lord rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty and peace. The sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy. |A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others regard as their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader has enough clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use it rather for the benefit of his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all jealousy, showers presents on the great man, and invites him continually to his court. An enlightened ruler and an obedient servant--this is the condition on which great progress depends.<br/>


*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
The sun rises over the earth: The image of PROGRESS. Thus the superior man himself Brightens his bright virtue.<br/>


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
The light of the sun rises over the earth is by nature clear. The higher the sun rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading the pristine purity of its rays over an ever widening area. The real nature of man is likewise originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with earthly things and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth in its native clarity.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means:<br/>
 ***

_Progressing, but turned back.<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br/>
If one meets with no confidence, one should remain calm.<br/>
No mistake.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
At a time when all elements are pressing for progress, we are still uncertain whether in the course of advance we may not meet with a rebuff. Then the thing to do is simply continue in what is right; in the end this will bring good fortune. It may be that we meet with no confidence. In this case we ought not to try to win confidence regardless of the situation, but should remain calm and cheerful and refuse to be roused to anger. Thus we remain free of mistakes.<br/>


*** Six in the second place means:<br/>
 ***

_Progressing, but in sorrow,<br/>
Perseverance brings good fortune,<br/>
Then one obtains great happiness from one's ancestress.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
Progress is halted; an individual is kept from getting in touch with the man in authority with whom he has a connection. When this happens, he must remain persevering, although he is grieved; then with a maternal gentleness the main question will bestow great happiness upon him. This happiness comes to him-and is well deserved-because in this case mutual attraction does not rest on selfish or partisan motives but on firm and correct principles.<br/>


*** Six in the third place means:<br/>
 ***

_All are in accord.<br/>
Remorse disappears.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
A man strives onward, in association with others whose backing encourages him. This dispels any cause for regret over the fact that he does not have enough independence to triumph unaided over every hostile turn of fate.<br/>


*** Nine in the fourth place means:<br/>
 ***

_Progress like a hamster.<br/>
Perseverance brings danger.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places to amass great possessions. But such conduct shuns the light. And since times of progress are inevitably brought to the light, perseverance in such action always leads to danger.<br/>


*** Six in the fifth place means:<br/>
 ***

_Remorse disappears.<br/>
Take not gain and loss to heart.<br/>
Undertakings bring good fortune.<br/>
Everything serves to further.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
The situation described here is that of one who, finding himself in an influential position in a time of progress, remains gentle and reserved. He might reproach himself for lack of energy in making the most of the propitiousness of the time and obtaining all possible advantage. However, this regret passes away. He must not take either loss or gain to heart; they are minor considerations. What matters much more is the fact that in this way he has assured himself of opportunities for successful and beneficent influence.<br/>


*** Nine at the top means:<br/>
 ***

_Making progress with the horns is permissible<br/>
Only for the purpose of punishing one's own city.<br/>
To be conscious of danger brings good fortune.<br/>
No blame.<br/>
Perseverance brings humiliation.<br/>
_

*** Commentary on the line ***
Making progress with lowered horns-i.e., acting on the offensive-is permissible, in times like those referred to here, only in dealing with the mistakes of one’s own people. Even then we must bear in mind that proceeding on the offensive may always be dangerous. In this way we avoid the mistakes that otherwise threaten, and succeed in what we set out to do. On the other hand, perseverance in such over energetic behavior, especially toward persons with whom there is no close connection, will lead to humiliation.<br/>
