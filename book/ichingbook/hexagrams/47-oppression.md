This trigram, with two emerging yang lines, is now in the domain of the yang.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of WATER <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of preparing, or internal yang, where the balanced state of WATER ascends and expands into the polar state of AIR.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang becomes dominant here, and the remaining yin is outnumbered. This is the time when the yang begins to reign.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang is no longer constrained by the limitation of the EARTH and is free to expand into what seems like limitless AIR.  This is the culmination of expression, and whatever the ultimate expression of an instance is, according to the nature of the instance, will be expressed here. <br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> What remains of that expression or how it lives on is something only history will know.

The quadrant of WATER<img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style="width:20px"/> exists between the dynamic properties of FILLING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style="width:20px"/> and COLLECTING <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style="width:20px"/>and represents the balance between the yin and yang. that is achieved when yang penetrates the yin at is center. The oceans and lakes have filled and are stagnant until the rivers form which serves to collect the water to return it to its cycles..  It is the most *inward* moving of all the states.<br/>

The trigram shows the symbol of yang energy penetrating the yin at its core. <br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> Water cedes to whatever holds it.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The movement of water is what gives it it power.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> it is the yielding quality of water that is its contributions. If always follows the path of least resistance, is used by every form of life and Nature itself, and is then returned, essentially unchanged. It takes nothing, and gives everything.



*** The Judgment: ***
OPPRESSION.<br/>
Success.<br/>
Perseverance.<br/>
The great man brings about good fortune.<br/>
No blame.<br/>
When one has something to say, It is not believed.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
Times of adversity are the reverse of times of success, but they can lead to success if they; befall the right man. When a strong man meets with adversity, he remains cheerful despite all danger, and this cheerfulness is the source of later successes; it is that stability which is stronger than fate. He who lets his spirit be broken by exhaustion certainly has no success. But if adversity only bends a man, it creates in him a power to react that is bound in time to manifest itself. No inferior man is capable of this. Only the great man brings about good fortune and remains blameless. It is true that for the time being outward influence is denied him because his words have no effect. Therefore in times of adversity, it is important to be strong within and sparing of words.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
There is no water in the lake: The image of EXHAUSTION. Thus the superior man stakes his life On following his will.

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
When the water has flowed out below, the lake must dry up and become exhausted. That is fate. This symbolizes an adverse fate in human life. In such times there is nothing a man can do but acquiesce in his fate and remain true to himself. This concerns the deepest stratum of his being, for this alone, is superior to all external fate.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_One sits oppressed under a bare tree<br/>
And strays into a gloomy valley.<br/>
For three years one sees nothing._

*** Commentary on the line ***
When adversity befalls a man, it is important above all things for him to be strong and to overcome the trouble inwardly. If he is weak, the trouble overwhelms him. Instead of proceeding on his way, he remains sitting under a bare tree and falls ever more deeply into gloom and melancholy. This makes the situation only more and more hopeless. Such an attitude comes from an inner delusion that he must by all means overcome.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_One is oppressed while at meat and drink.<br/>
The man with the scarlet knee bands is just coming.<br/>
It furthers one to offer sacrifice.<br/>
To set forth brings misfortune.<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
This pictures a state of inner oppression. Externally, all is well, one has meat and drink. But one is exhausted by the commonplaces of life, and there seems to be no way of escape. Then help comes from a high place. A prince-in ancient China princes wore scarlet knee bands- is in search of able helpers.But there are still obstructions to be overcome. Therefore it is important to meet these obstructions in the visible realm by offerings and prayer. To set forth without being prepared would be disastrous, though not morally wrong.Here a disagreeable situation must be overcome by patience of spirit.

*** Six in the third place means: ***

_A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone<br/>
And leans on thorns and thistles.<br/>
He enters the house and does not see his wife.<br/>
Misfortune. _

*** Commentary on the line ***
This shows a man who is restless and indecisive in times of adversity. At first, he wants to push ahead, then he encounters obstructions that, it is true, mean oppression only when recklessly dealt with. He butts his head against a wall and in consequence, feels himself oppressed by the wall. Then he leans on things that have in themselves no stability and that are merely a hazard for him who leans on them. Thereupon he turns back irresolutely and retires into his house, only to find, as a fresh disappointment, that his wife is not there. <br/>
<br/>
Confucius says about this line: If a man permits himself to be oppressed by something that ought not to oppress him, his name will certainly be disgraced. If he leans on things upon which one cannot lean, his life will certainly be endangered. For him who is in disgrace and danger, the hour of death draws near; how can he then still see his wife?

*** Nine in the fourth place means: ***

_He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage.<br/>
Humiliation, but the end is reached._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A well-to-do man sees the need of the lower classes and would like very much to be of help. But instead of proceeding with speed and energy where their need, he begins in a hesitant and measured way. Then he encounters obstructions. Powerful and wealthy acquaintances draw him into their circle; he has to do as they do and cannot withdraw from them. Hence he finds himself in great embarrassment. But the trouble is transitory. The original strength of his nature offsets the mistake he has made, and the goal is reached.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_His nose and feet are cut off.<br/>
Oppression at the hands of the man with the purple knee bands.<br/>
Joy comes softly.<br/>
It furthers one to make offerings and libations._

*** Commentary on the line ***
An individual who has the good of mankind at heart is oppressed from above and below (this is the meaning of the cutting off of the nose a defeat). He finds no help among the people whose duty it would be to aid in the work of rescue(ministers wore purple knee bands). But little by little, things take a turn for the better. Until that time, he should turn to God, firm in his inner composure, and pray and offer sacrifice for the general well-being.

*** Six at the top means: ***

_He is oppressed by creeping vines.<br/>
He moves uncertainly and says, "Movement brings remorse."<br/>
If one feels remorse over this and makes a start,<br/>
Good fortune comes._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A man is oppressed by bonds that can easily be broken. The distress is drawing to an end. But he is still irresolute; he is still influenced by the previous condition and fears that he may have cause for regret if he makes a move. But as soon as he grasps the situation, changes this mental attitude, and makes a firm decision, he masters the oppression.
