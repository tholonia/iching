# <span style="color:gray">THE GENTLE (THE PENETRATING, WIND) /  Sun </span>
Hexagram: 57
Binary Sequence: 54 (110110)

* Upper trigram: 5 (6) SUN / The Gentle / Wind & Wood

* Lower trigram: 5 (6) SUN / The Gentle / Wind & Wood

## <span style="brown:gray">Tholonic trigrams: </span>

### <span style="brown:gray">Upper </span>

* (6) Release / RELEASE represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient ( lightening, Big Bang, inspiration)

### <span style="brown:gray">Explanation</span>

* *Release* represent accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. expression of Instance of this are **lightening**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.<br/>
<br/>
The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest place of 1, beginning, birth, plant, idea.  The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.<br/>
<br/>
The quadrant of AIR <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style="width:20px"/> and FIRE <img src="../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style="width:20px"/>is one of outward descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction.  When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE.  The process of *release* is defined by the three states of trigram 6.  This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world.  *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. *Negotiation*: <img src="../Images/bc/yin.png" style="width:30px"/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point.  Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.<br/>
2. *Definition*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushed against the limitations of the yin.<br/>
3. *Contribution*: <img src="../Images/bc/yang.png" style="width:30px"/> The yang finds expression in FIRE, even if at the cost of the yin.  <br/>

*** The Judgment: ***
THE GENTLE.<br/>
Success through what is small.<br/>
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br/>
It furthers one to see the great man.


*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the Judgment</span> ***
Penetration produces gradual and inconspicuous effects. It should be effected not by an act of violation but by influence that never lapses.Results of this kind are less striking to the eye than those won by surprise attack, but they are more enduring and more complete. If one would produce such effects, one must have a clearly defined goal, for only when the penetrating influence works always in the same direction can the object be attained. Small strength can achieve its purpose only by subordinating itself to an eminent man who is capable of creating order.

*** <span style="color:gray">The 'IMAGE' of the hexagram</span> ***
Winds following one upon the other: The image of THE GENTLY PENETRATING. Thus the superior man

*** <span style="color:gray">An Explanation of the 'IMAGE'</span> ***
Spreads his commands abroad And carries out his undertakings. The penetrating quality of the wind depends upon its ceaselessness. This is what makes it so powerful; time is its instrument. In the same way, the rulers thought should penetrate the soul of the people. This too requires a lasting influence brought about by enlightenment and command. Only when the command has been assimilated by the people is action in accordance with it possible.Action without preparation of the ground only frightens and repels.

## The Six Lines ##
---
*** Six at the beginning means: ***

_In advancing and in retreating, <br/>
The perseverance of a warrior furthers._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Inborn gentleness is often carried to the point of indecisiveness. One does not feel strong enough to advance resolutely. A thousand doubts crop up; one, however, not minded to withdraw but drifts indecisively to and fro. In such a situation, a military decisiveness is a proper thing, so that one resolutely does what order demands. Resolute discipline is far better than irresolute license.

*** Nine in the second place means: ***

_Penetration under the bed,<br/>
Priests and magicians are used in great number,<br/>
Good fortune,<br/>
No blame._

*** Commentary on the line ***
At times one has to deal with hidden enemies, intangible influences that slink into dark corners and from this hiding affect people by suggestion. In instances like this, it is necessary to trace these things back to the most secret recesses, in order to determine the nature of the influences to be dealt with. This is the task of the priests; removing the influences is the task of the magicians. The very anonymity of such plotting requires an especially vigorous and indefatigable effort, but this is well worthwhile.For when such elusive influences are brought into the light and branded, they lose their power over people.

*** Nine in the third place means: ***

_Repeated penetration.<br/>
Humiliation._

*** Commentary on the line ***
Penetrating reflection must not be pushed too far, lest it cripple the power of decision. After a matter has been thoroughly pondered, it is essential to form a decision and to act. Repeated deliberation brings fresh doubts and scruples, and thereby humiliation because one shows oneself unable to act.

*** Six in the fourth place means: ***

_Remorse vanishes.<br/>
During the hunt.<br/>
Three kinds of game are caught._

*** Commentary on the line ***
When a responsible position and accumulated experience lead one to combine innate modesty with energetic action, great success is assured. The three kinds of animals referred to served for offerings to the gods, for feasting guests, and for everyday consumption. When the catch answered all three purposes, the hunt was considered especially successful.

*** Nine in the fifth place means: ***

_Perseverance brings good fortune.<br/>
Remorse vanishes.<br/>
Nothing that does not further.<br/>
No beginning, but an end.<br/>
Before the change, three days.<br/>
After the change, three days.<br/>
Good fortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
 In the situation described in Ku, WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED (18), an entirely new point of departure must be set up, whereas here it is only a question of reforms. The beginning has not been good, but the moment has been reached when a new direction can be taken. Change and improvement are called for. Such steps must be undertaken with steadfastness, that is, with a firm and correct attitude of mind; then they will succeed, and remorse will disappear. But it must be remembered that such improvements require careful consideration. Before a change is made, it must be pondered over again and again. After the change is made, it is necessary to note carefully for sometime after how the improvements bear the test of actuality. Such careful work is accompanied by good fortune.

*** Nine at the top means: ***

_Penetration under the bed.<br/>
He loses his property and his ax.<br/>
Perseverance brings misfortune._

*** Commentary on the line ***
A man's understanding is sufficiently penetrating. He follows up injurious influences into the most secret corners. But he no longer has the strength to combat them decisively. In this case, any attempt to penetrate into the personal domain of darkness would only bring harm.
